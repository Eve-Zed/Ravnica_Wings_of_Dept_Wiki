Sphinxes are large and powerful creatures with lion-like bodies, human faces, and feathered wings. Some rival dragons in size and strength.
 
 Sphinxes of [[Ravnica]] are typically affiliated with the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]]. They are solitary creatures that value their privacy but are also willing to share their insights with each other in times of need.
 
Azorius sphinxes, known as sphinxes of judgement, wield [[Hieromancer|hieromancy]]—the power of law magic—with the force of a judge's gavel to imprison criminals and compel truth from them

A few Sphinxes are aligned with [[House Dimir]] and also count as nightmares.
