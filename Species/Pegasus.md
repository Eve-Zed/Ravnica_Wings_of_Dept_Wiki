Winged, sapient horses, pegasi are as majestic as they are elusive. Most avoid the affairs of other creatures, preferring to dwell amid idyllic pastures. Others aim to aiding heroes in need. In rare cases, pegasi might befriend virtuous people and serve as their companions and steeds.

Pegasi are hunted by servants of evil, leading many of these winged steeds to flee strangers on sight. To gain the trust of a pegasus one may be:
- Bearing the gear of a hero the pegasus aided.
- Offering magical fruit or holy spring water.
- Singing a song in Celestial, Druidic, or Sylvan.
- Wearing the garb of an ancient heroic order.

The pegasi of [[Ravnica]], as far as can be told, are almost all wild. Although surprisingly, such a useful animal could survive on the city plane without being domesticated by someone. Although Equenauts of the [[Selesnya Conclave]] ride pegasi, combining the role of mounted warriors and scouts.
