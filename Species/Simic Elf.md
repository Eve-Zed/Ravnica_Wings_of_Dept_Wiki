There was once a third tribe of [[Elf|elves]] on [[Ravnica]], one that became largely extinct during the pre-[[Guildpact]] wars; the survivors joined the [[Simic Combine]]. Little is known about them, but both the [[Devkarin]] and the [[Silhana]] believe they were very cruel and unpleasant. Simic elves seem to have been mostly bald. As time went by, almost all of the Simic elves subjected themselves to strange biological experiments, adding biomechanical implants or splicing their genes with those of other creatures, such as [[Snake|snakes]].
