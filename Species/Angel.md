# Firemane Angels
Within the [[Boros Legion|Boros]], angels are considered to be incarnations of the spirit of justice and revenge. They are considered to be the top members of the guild, whose [[parun]] [[Razia]] is an angel herself. Razia created all other Boros angels as clones, reflections, or copies of herself. They all lived in the floating hall called the [[Parhelion]].

Boros angels possess no need to drink, eat, or sleep, but can if it so pleases them. They have enhanced strength, a strong sense of duty and morality, and are supposedly incapable of lying. Boros angels can hear people calling their names from anywhere in [[Ravnica]].

The only surviving first-generation angel is [[Feather]], who became the Guildmaster after Razia's death. Following in her progenitor's footsteps, Feather created a new lineage of angels. Feather was later replaced by one of these Angels, [[Aurelia]], who argued that a disgraced angel can't command authority or respect. They have only two wings, unlike the original generation which had four wings.

# Angels of Despair and Deathpact Angels
The angels of the [[Orzhov Syndicate]] are those that are dissatisfied with the way the Legion works. If an angel begins to doubt the purity of her mission and her doubts are allowed to fester into cynicism, the [[Orzhova|Church of Deals]] is always ready to welcome them, luring them with status, respect and power. Orzhov angels are empty voids whose only fulfilment comes from the performance of duty. They may act as executioners, commanders or pontiffs, but more often tend to carve out their own unique roles in the guild. They act without mercy, and appear only on special occasions such as high ceremonies, where they inspire awe and fear in onlookers.

# Unguilded Angels
In the wake of Aurelia's leadership and her assaults on parts of the Ravnican population that she deemed complicit in crimes, several angels left the Boros and dedicated themselves to the protection of the [[The Guildless|guildless]].
