Giants are towering beings with humanlike shapes. The giants of Ravnica are aligned to five [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]]. The [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] are known to reanimate their corpses as servants for their own.

Those giants employed by the [[Boros Legion]] originate in the [[Skorskal clan]], which has an ancient feud with the [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]. The Boros mainly use the giants sworn to them for guard duty of their most important strongholds, including [[Sunhome]]. They can go for eight hours without blinking.

The giants in service to the [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] often act as bouncers and enforcers, although some become part of their performances, holding mobile platforms and acting as pillars.

Giants among the [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]] usually patrol marketplaces, reminding the debtors of the Church to pay their bills in a timely manner.

The giants among the [[Gruul Clans]] are known as sunder shamans and channel their rage to enhance their own attacks. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban development that encroaches on the wilds where they once lived - not least because they have so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through buildings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possible.
