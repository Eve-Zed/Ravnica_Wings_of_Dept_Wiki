Ravnican spirits come in several variants, some mirroring the species they were in life, others twisted into near animalistic forms. Since the spirits of the departed usually stay active on the plane, the denizens have learned to cope with their existence, usually by leaving them small offerings to avoid their wrath. Others find themselves harassed by [[Goblin|goblins]]. Ways to ensure a spirit does not rise is to pay the exorbitant fee for a Proper Burial conducted by the guilds.

Among the guilds, the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]], [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]], and [[House Dimir|Dimir]] dealt with spirits. The Azorius utilize spirits as untiring bureaucrats and protectors of the laws of the [[Guildpact]]. The Orzhov are ruled by an aristocracy of undead ghosts that form the highest council of the guild, [[Obzedat|the Deathless]]. Being raised as a spirit is a high honor for guild members, while it is an unfortunate fate for those unable to pay their debts in life to the lesser ranks. The Dimir use them as spies and infiltrators, often turning to those spirits that are so ancient that their names are all but forgotten.

[[Agyrem]] acted as the quarter for the ghosts of the departed. Even after the Guildpact broke, its laws still held sway there.
