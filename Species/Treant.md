Ancient inhabitants of the forest, treants are gigantic, animate trees with wizened faces. Most have lived for centuries and know secrets of the natural world. They avoid becoming embroiled in the conflicts of shorter-lived creatures, but they're protective of their forest homes. If roused to anger, treants can animate trees to aid them.

Treants defend and are shaped by secrets of the forest. This secrets could be:
- Blessed by [[Mat'Selesnya]] and grows magic fruit.
- Growing atop the entrance to a dungeon or gateway to the [[Selesnya Conclave]] or the [[Gruul Clans]].
- Home to a community of [[Pixie|pixies]] or [[Sprite|sprites]].
- The last lore keeper of lost druidic knowledge.
- Rooted on a hero's burial mound and animates trees that look like questing knights.
- Scarred by a fire and holds the bones of the arsonist who started it in a hollow.
