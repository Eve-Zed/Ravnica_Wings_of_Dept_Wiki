Deathpact angels dwell in the grandest of [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]] cathedrals, where they surround themselves with wealth and wretched vassals that are utterly in their thrall.

###### Gift Givers 
Posing as a beneficent god, a deathpact angel attracts petitioners who beg the [[angel]] for blessings: wealth, prestige, health, revenge, and the like. Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild. True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts.

###### Debt and Indenture
Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as [[Indentured Spirit|indentured spirits]].

> [!important] Dept Paid
A deathpact angel can give an indentured spirit a clause to escape its bound servitude: if the angel ever dies, the indentured spirit can sacrifice its undead existence to restore the angel to life. Upon seeing the angel drop dead, an indentured spirit can destroy itself, its debt discharged as it dissipates, after which the angel returns to life.
