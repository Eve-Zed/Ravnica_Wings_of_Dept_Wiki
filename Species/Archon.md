Archons are enigmatic, supernatural embodiments of the harshest aspects of law and order. They espouse a rigid sense of justice and deal ruthless punish ment to those who break the law. This nature often aligns them with the [[Azorius Senate]], and they are commonly seen circling above the Azorius guildhall astride their winged [[felidar]] mounts, soaring alongside [[griffon]]-mounted hussars. An archon appears as an armored humanoid figure, nearly always mounted. Its face is usually shadowed beneath a large hood; those who have seen beneath the hood describe a face of celestial beauty with a stern ex pression and blank white eyes. Eternal Riders. The bond between an archon and its winged felidar mount is so close that the two are sometimes considered a single being, acting with a single mind. If an archon is ever thrown from its saddle, it can magically return to its place astride its mount in an instant.
