Archons are mystical celestial beings that are heavily aligned with the principles of White. They have obscured faces, and always appear on a flying steed.

Archons seem to be closely aligned to the [[Azorius Senate]], who embody the law on the plane, as opposed to the [[Angel|angels]] that are leaders of the [[Boros Legion]] or within the [[Orzhov Syndicate]]; [[The Guildless|guildless]] Archons exist but currently they are mostly found within the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]]. Their presence is strong enough that people willingly submit to them and cease fighting. They ride [[Lion|lions]] and [[Felidar|felidars]]. Though rider and mount are metaphysically linked and bonded, they are separate beings.
