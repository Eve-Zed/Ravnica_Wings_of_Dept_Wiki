The minotaurs of [[Ravnica]] are strong in body, dedication, and courage. They are at home on the battlefield, willing to fight for their various causes. They combine a burning fury in battle with keen tactics that make them excellent commanders as well as valuable shock troops.
###### Horns and Hooves
Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.

Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but minotaurs of the [[Orduun Family|Ordruun clan]] (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony; they find the heavy armor of the [[Boros legion]] much more comfortable without a long tail in the way.
###### Strength and Zeal
Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the [[Gruul Clans]], but the minotaurs of the Ordruun family line, long associated with the Boros Legion, are much better known and respected. Boros minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the fury of the pack.

Minotaurs tend to vent their outrage through violence, but they aren't generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes.
###### Family and Guild
Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes—perhaps they were once thought of as gods—who established the minotaurs' place in the world. Every minotaur in [[Ravnica]] claims descent from one of these heroes. The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with thousands of members descended from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the arts of war. Other important family lines include the [[Kharran line]] (primarily associated with the Gruul [[Scab clan]]), the [[Drendaa line]] (found scattered among the Gruul Clans), and the [[Tazgral line]] (divided between the Boros and the Gruul, with a significant number in the [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] as well).

Since each family line has so many members, minotaurs don't usually find it helpful to connect the name of the line to their personal names; even though [[Grozdan|Commander Grozdan]] of the Boros Legion's [[Kamen Fortress]] is a prominent member of the Ordruun line, he would never call himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a [[human]] would.
