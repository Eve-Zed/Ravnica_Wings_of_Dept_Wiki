Dryad are spirits of trees, taking a [[nymph]]-like or [[treefolk]] form to relate to the [[Humanoid|humanoids]] that venture near their forests.

The Dryads of [[Ravnica]] are closely aligned with the [[Selesnya Conclave]]. Dryads are believed to be in contact with the "Worldsoul" and [[Mat'Selesnya]]. The leafy hair of Ravnican dryads changes colour with the seasons.
