# Orzhov Thrulls
When the [[Orzhov Syndicate]] rips a soul from its body to create a [[spirit]], the cast-off remains go to the [[Fleshmage|fleshmages]], who use their necromantic magic to liquefy the corpse and transform it into something useful. These creations become thrulls, obedient slaves that serve in a variety of menial roles: labourers, messengers, beasts of burden, and even fashion accessories for the elite. Whatever tasks they perform, they wear faceplates forged from devalued coinage to conceal their ghastly features.

## Servitor Thrull
The most wretched of thrulls are the servitors, small and slender, that serve as playthings for their Orzhov masters. They run trivial errands, transport small items, caper and dance, and keep their masters' expensive robes from trailing on the dirty street. They are utterly loyal, lacking any concept of thinking for themselves.
## Winged Thrull
Winged thrulls are at once the most intelligent of Orzhov thrulls (which isn't saying much), as well as the smallest, most unobtrusive, and most mobile. They act as messengers and spies for their Orzhov masters and tend to mimic the mannerisms and movements of the oligarchs they serve.

# Rakdos Thrulls
The origin of [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] thrulls is even more sinister and disgusting than those of the Orzhov. The Rakdos are not overly concerned with their creations' lifespan, as long as they are capable to cause sufficient damage.
