Shapeshifters are a loosely-defined group of beings capable of assuming other shapes and forms, often imitating other beings.
# Humanoids
[[House Dimir|Dimir]] agents such as the Doppelgangers or [[Lazav]] use their constantly shifting physiology to infiltrate places and organisations.
# Lupuls
Lupul is a name derived from the Old Ravi word for "lurker". They are shapeshifters that follow the [[vampire]] [[Szadek]]. In their natural forms, they have the form of a mass of blue-white worms that can move as a single creature with surprising speed and dexterity. In this form, they are similar to insects and as such those akin to the bugs can communicate with them and to some extent control them, one such example is [[Jarad vod Savo|Jarad]] the [[Devkarin|devkarin]] hunter. They shapeshift by consuming others, and once they have consumed a living thing in its natural form, they can later change into that creature's form whenever they choose. Lupuls are extremely stealthy and nearly impossible to catch.

Thought to have been defeated centuries before the [[Guildpact#Decamillennial Celebration|Decamillennial]], they resurfaced under Szadek's commands, until his control was disrupted by Jarad.
