Griffins combine the features of raptors and big cats—most commonly eagles and lions—and possess the precision and ferocity of such predators. Rarer breeds of griffins have the features of condors and panthers, while others resemble hawks and tigers.

Countless tales surround griffins. According to them they may:
- Attack anything in the skies near their lairs.
- Curse their killers. Those who slay a griffin face the enmity of all animals.
- Lay eggs with remarkable healing properties.
- Prefer the taste of horses over all other prey.
- Serve the first creature they see after hatching.
- Won't attack those with royal blood.

Ravnican griffins were originally piscivores, who later adapted to hunting in the streets after [[Ravnica]]'s oceans dried up. Several wild griffins now stalk the city and prey on those not able to defend themselves. The [[Boros Legion|Boros]] use them as mounts and the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]] are known to feed lawbreakers to them. These griffins developed resistance to magic. [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] griffins are also known as part of it's [[teratogen]] social class.
