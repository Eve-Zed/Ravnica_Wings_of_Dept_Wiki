Gargoyles are generally part of the roofscape of the city, with some being several thousand years old. They come to life to protect the buildings from attack or unwelcome intrusion. The [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]] gargoyles, especially, are infamous for their ability to unleash horrific high-pitched screams that can even break bones and that wake the dead.

Some Gargoyles, constructed from [[Nullstone]], can dampen forms of magic, heat, sound, and light around them.
