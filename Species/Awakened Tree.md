Awakened Trees are a type of [[awakened plant]]. Some awakened trees stand in still, meditative states for long periods, making them easy to mistake for normal plants, while others patrol regions of natural power. Awakened trees are sometimes brought to life by influences from [[Dryad|dryads]] and [[Mat'Selesnya]], which make them colorful and endlessly blooming.
