In the sprawling city of [[Ravnica]], where "open road" seems like a contradiction and "open plain" is sheer nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of wide spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run—in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop.
###### Nature's Cavalry 
Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular [[Human|humans]], displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of [[Elf|elves]]. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration—from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. [[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]] centaurs favor long, flowing hair. [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles.

The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts.
###### Affinity for Nature
Centaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the [[rubblebelts]] of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the [[undercity]] tunnels of the [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] and the laboratories of the [[Simic Combine|Simic]].

Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse-like bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts.
###### Clans and Community
Centaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did.
