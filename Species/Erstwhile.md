The Erstwhile is an ancient faction of elvish aristocrats that were entombed in the modern [[Undercity]]. The [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] have unearthed their coffins and reanimated them as part of the Swarm. They still wear their stately attire, despite its moldering condition, and they lend an air of high culture to the undercity court of the Golgari.
