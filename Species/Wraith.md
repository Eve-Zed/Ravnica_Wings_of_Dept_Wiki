Wraiths are spectral evils, life-hungry embodiments of malice and terror. Arising from the souls of tyrants, moments of catastrophic pain, or magical blasphemies, wraiths spread suffering and the torment of undeath. [[Humanoid|Humanoids]] that die near a wraith might be entrapped by the foul spirit and rise as [[Specter|specters]] bound to the wraith's sinister will.

Wraiths lurk in forgotten dungeons, accursed ruins or shady mausoleums. Such haunted domains might bear hints of the tragedies or foul magic that brought the wraiths into being.

Wraiths might arise from a single powerfully evil soul or other baleful forces.
A wraith can embody
- The blasphemous magic of a cursed location.
- The exorcised evil of a redeemed villain.

- Locals' fear of a superstition or legend.
- The memory of a tragedy.
- A profane idea or foul piece of lore.

- The viciousness of a profane Artifact.
- The vile dreams of a slumbering [[Fiend|fiend]].
