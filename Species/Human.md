Humans are a scant majority among the peoples of [[Ravnica]], dominating some [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]] and barely represented in others. As on other worlds, they are innovators, achievers, and pioneers whose daring and adaptability make them capable of great things—and great falls.

Not one of the [[Parun|paruns]] of the [[Ravnican guilds|ten guilds]] was human, although the [[Obzedat|Ghost Council]] of the [[Orzhov Syndicate]] is of human origin. Likewise, no current guildmaster is human. But humans are lieutenants, advisors, and strategists in many guilds. Their ambition and drive propel them toward the top, but the sheer might of beings such as [[Dragon|ancient dragons]], [[Sphinx|sphinxes]], and [[Demon|demons]] keeps humans one rung down from the pinnacle of power.

The humans of [[Ravnica]] are no less physically diverse than those of other worlds. Similarly, they are varied in their inclinations: they alone are found in every guild.
