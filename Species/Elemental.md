Elementals are sentient beings composed of elemental energy. The most common varieties are those of the classical elements, expressing themselves as air, fire, earth, and water elementals. Many more exotic manifestations also exist, such as elementals of lightning, thorns, fungus, rust and even time.

Elementals are found throughout the city-plane of [[Ravnica]]. Most Ravnican elementals are bestial in intelligence, form, and ecological niche, though some distinct races of sentient, humanoid elementals exist on the plane as well.
