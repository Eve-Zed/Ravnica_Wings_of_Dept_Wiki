Bats  are primarily associated with the [[Orzhov Syndicate]]. They are used as assassins and messengers.

Giant bats are also used as mounts by the [[Golgari Swarm]], particularly by the guild's hunters.

The [[House Dimir|Dimir]] seem to have acquired bat-motifs, such as in the architecture and the design of their [[Horror|Horrors]].
