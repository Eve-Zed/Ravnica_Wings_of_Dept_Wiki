Intellect devourers serve their creators by consuming other creatures' brains and puppetising the mindless bodies. These quadrupedal brains seek to ambush sapient beings, then drain their thoughts until they're mindless. Then, if their victims are [[Humanoid|Humanoids]], they enter the creatures' skulls. With access to the victims' knowledge and control of their bodies, intellect devourers use their perfect disguises to pass as the people they've replaced.

Intellect Devourers are strongly affiliated with [[House Dimir]].
