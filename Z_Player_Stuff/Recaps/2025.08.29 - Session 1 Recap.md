# Scene 1: Introduction
[[Laucian]] was tasked with both watch over [[Valanya Tindóme|Valanya]] as a new trainee and two prisoners who are given the chance to work for their freedom:
- [[Azriel]] arrested for running an illegal gambling operation and
- [[Samira]] arrested for interfering in a construction site on private property
They were introduced and given the conditions and mission briefing by [[Julius Pavlic]]

Their task was to investigate a [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] wandering circus in the [[Smelting Quarter]] that was accused of illegal activities involving a [[Celestial]].
# Scene 2: Gathering Intel
To gather information the newly founded investigation unit travelled to the [[Precinct Six]] they asked around the merchants about the circus.
- [[Barthos]] the [[Goblin]] pottery merchant, he didn't have useful information but he sold a potted plant to Samira claiming it contains herbs.
- A shady merchant had more information after [[Azriel]] offered a bit of coin and bought a strange potion of him, he said that the circus is in possession of an imprisoned [[Angel]].
# Scene 3: The wandering circus
The circus was still under construction there were [[Orc|Orcs]] preparing the stage and guarding seemingly important wagons and tents.
Orchestrating the construction was a [[Human]] with horns and elaborate robes named [[Lumis]].
In the back behind the stage Acrobats were practicing their tricks. And there were two guarded cages one on a wagon in the back and on central on the stage.
