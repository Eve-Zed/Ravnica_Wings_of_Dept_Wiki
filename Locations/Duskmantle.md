Duskmantle was the guildhall of [[House Dimir]] during [[Szadek]]'s reign. It was a hidden castle located in the [[Undercity]] whose location was only known to its residents. After Szadek's demise, both the location and way of gaining entry were lost. [[Lazav]] recreated the structure in a different part of the Undercity, shielding it with potent memory wards (not unlike those of the original guildhall).
