Although the [[Selesnya Conclave]] believe that power is not centered in any one location, the massive world-tree Vitu-Ghazi has served for more than 10,000 years as the focus and guildhall of the guild.

Vitu-Ghazi was a mammoth tree nearly as tall as [[New Prahv]]. Buildings shaped from the living wood nestled in its huge, curving branches, connected by an intricate network of hanging bridges and ladders. Inside the main trunk there was a cathedral to nature, where worshippers came from all around [[Ravnica]], and which also served as home to the guildmaster [[Trostani]] and the [[Dryad Conclave]]. At night, the branches of Vitu-Ghazi were lit aglow with firefly light. The tree is re-enervated annually in an invite-only ceremony.

Vitu-Ghazi was once the greatest tree on Ravnica. Although struck down long ago, [[dryad]] and [[Elf]] magic kept it alive at the center of Ravnica's oldest and largest district.

As guildhall, Vitu-Ghazi was where [[Mat'Selesnya]] slept, and it was uprooted partially by [[Szadek]] so he could drink Mat'Selesnya. It was also severely damaged by the [[nephilim]], and in the fight between [[Project Kraj]] and [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]. During an attempt to siphon its power, [[Sifa Grent]] sent Rakdos cultists to attack the tree, receiving a deep wound from an axe-wielding [[demon]]. Nonetheless, it still seemed to stand proud. Its mending were however superficial. Beneath the bark it was fragile, with stress fractures running through its branches, and hidden support struts barely able to take the weight.
