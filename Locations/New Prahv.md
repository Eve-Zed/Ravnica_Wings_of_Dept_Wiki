New Prahv, at the other end of the same district, consists of three towering, three-sided columns that form a circular courtyard. The towers of New Prahv are the tallest structures on the ground in all of [[Ravnica]]. The three towers literalize the guild's structure: each houses the operations of one of the three Columns ([[Azorius Senate#The Sova Column|Sova]], [[Azorius Senate#The Jelenn Column|Jelenn]], and [[Azorius Senate#The Lyev Column|Lyev]]). The three titanic towers are flanked by the domes and spires of lesser buildings. The borders of the enormous compound are marked by tall, spiked fences.

The towers of New Prahv also serve as an aesthetic representation of the guild's belief. It is an austere, immaculate structure, elegant but unadorned. White marble, alabaster, and steel predominate. Broad, curving hallways lead to large chambers, each of which has an array of subchambers and offices around it. Because the halls and chambers don't have many distinguishing features, visitors to New Prahv inevitably become lost without an escort.

The [[Isperia|guildmaster]]'s office is located in the highest spire of the complex.
