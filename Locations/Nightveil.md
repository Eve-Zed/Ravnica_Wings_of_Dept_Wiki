The sprawling residence of many of the [[House Dimir]] elite, parts of Nightveil overlap the [[Tenth District]] in the [[Undercity|undercily]]. An extensive system of natural caverns houses, high-walled mansions and sunken crypts that have a grand, sinister motif. Patrolling [[Specter#Nightveil Specter|specters]] and other incorporeal [[Undead|undead]] make it difficult for the unwelcome to enter.
