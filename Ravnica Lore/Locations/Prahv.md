The first Prahv was a large castle-like structure of white marble. It was destroyed by the explosion of the crashed [[Boros Legion|Boros]] [[Angel|angels]]' fortress-ship, the [[Parhelion]]. The site of Prahv's ruins has been given over to nature and has become a wilderness preserve.

Years of paralysed bureaucracy passed while the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]] discussed where, when, and how they should rebuild their guildhall. Only when [[Isperia]] accepted leadership of the guild did the process of rebuilding begin (see also [[New Prahv]]).
