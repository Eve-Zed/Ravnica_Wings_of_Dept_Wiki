The Tenth District is the hub of most important activity on [[Ravnica]], and this is reflected in grander architecture, busier markets, and wilder traffic in the streets. To be governed effectively, the Tenth District is broken into six precincts, each the size of a small city. [[Precinct One]] (also known as the [[Guildpact]] Precinct) is the hub of the wealthy and powerful and [[Precinct Two]] is populated by businesses. In [[Precinct Three]] (the Greenbelt), nature has encroached on the urban environment, while the scarred streets of [[Precinct Four]] are a proving ground for soldiers and marauders alike. [[Precinct Five]] is characterized by its many schools, libraries, and laboratories, and [[Precinct Six]] is the workers' district with warehouses, docks, and factories.

Two major avenues and one alley run across the whole Tenth District, crossing precinct lines:

- The [[Transguild Promenade]]. Lined with markets and parks.
- [[Tin Street]], a vital center of trade and a popular spot for restaurants and theaters. At some points, it is possible to look down Tin Street and see [[Vitu-Ghazi]].
- [[Gnat Alley]], Ravnica's longest continuous street. A tunnel-like alley that serves as one of [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]'s most trusted methods of navigating through Ravnica's posh neighborhoods. Various lowlifes use its winding passages to infiltrate restricted districts and bypass security checkpoints.

Anchored by enormous chains at the juncture of Precincts One, Three, and Four, the [[Millennial Platform]] is a floating observation deck that affords the best overhead view of the District. It houses an exclusive restaurant.
