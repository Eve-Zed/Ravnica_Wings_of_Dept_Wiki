The Parhelion was the great hall where the [[Boros Legion|Boros]] [[Angel|angels]] resided.

The Parhelion was first constructed as a skyship in an attempt to find out about [[Ravnica]]'s [[planeswalker]] visitors who had stopped coming, but when the angels flew it to the edge of Ravnica's existence, they encountered only emptiness. Built with scraps from what magic and artifacts the visitors had left behind, its mana-powered propulsion system was described as a type of reality engine and is what allowed the ship to enter [[Agyrem]]. The Parhelion was later repurposed as the Boros headquarters and was located high above the city of Ravnica, amongst the clouds. In times of war, the Parhelion would descend and dock with [[Sunhome]].

The angel [[Feather]] was restricted from the Parhelion for some unknown reason, and as punishment her wings were bound and she was forced to serve the [[Wojek League|Wojek]], amongst normal mortals. An unknown time later, [[Szadek]], who was enslaved by [[Augustin IV]] at the time, managed to gain access to the Parhelion and managed to kill its residents. He then planned to use it to destroy [[Prahv]] and the Guilds. Although his plan was stopped by [[Agrus Kos]], the Parhelion was destroyed.

The Parhelion was rebuilt as the Parhelion II, also known as the Response Garrison and the Floating Citadel and is used by the Boros as a flying fortress. It is home to the Boros battle angels, with [[Griffin]] skyknights making up a significant portion of its soldiers. It houses two floating warships.
