The Ordruun line of [[Minotaur|minotaurs]] are the most prominent on [[Ravnica]]. They descend from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the art of war. The Ordruun have vowed allegiance to the [[Boros Legion]] and the [[Wojek League|Wojeks]]. They perform the "Hammer Duty" and have a powerband in the legion of 13. Ordruun are the peacekeepers of the communities, by handling menial tasks, like domestic disturbances, transferring prisoners, and upholding the Laws of Ravnica. Generations of minotaurs of the Ordruun family line have served with honor and distinction, claiming more than fifteen generals to their lineage.
