Clerics, who aspire to serve an important function in the [[Orzhov Syndicate]], which continues to maintain the outward appearance of a religious institution, can serve as priests. Once they earn a position of respect in the syndicate, they will hear confessions and dole out penance (which is always of a financial nature). Their "calling" centres on collecting monetary tithes and offerings in a wide range of forms. Their spell casting ability comes from the collective power of the spirits that rule the guild, not from a god.

There might even be a most unusual priest for the syndicate—one who thinks the guild's wealth should be used to ease the suffering of the downtrodden. They believe in the inspiration and delight that beautiful pageantry can offer to the world. But those who seek to distribute wealth and share beauty, rather than hoard them, must do so discreetly to avoid the ire of the [[Obzedat]].
