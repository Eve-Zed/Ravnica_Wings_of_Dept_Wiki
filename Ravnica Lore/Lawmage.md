(aka Advokists) are specialised mages under the employ of the [[Azorius Senate]] and [[Orzhov Syndicate]]. They draw upon the binding power of the [[Guildpact]] to restrain criminals and then serve as lawyers once those criminals are taken to court. Azorius lawmages are typically the prosecution, while Orzhov lawmages are the defence.
