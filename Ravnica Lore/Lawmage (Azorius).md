[[Lawmage|Lawmages]] in the [[Azorius Senate]], use magic to compel or restrain malefactors and scofflaws. They might also use your magic to protect Azorius soldiers and innocent bystanders from harm. In any case, they're called a lawmage, and can aspire to the title of justiciar and then deputy as your standing within the guild increases.
