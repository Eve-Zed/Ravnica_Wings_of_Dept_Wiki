Awakened shrubs are a type of [[Awakened Plant]] and can be any sort of small plant, from forest bushes to clustered flowers. They often appear near [[Awakened Tree]] or in regions imbued with primal magic. Some have whimsical appearances or foliage resembling rudimentary facial features, while others look like animate topiary creatures.
