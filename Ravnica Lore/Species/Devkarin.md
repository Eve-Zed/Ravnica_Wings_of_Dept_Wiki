Devkarin are the dark [[Elf|elves]] of [[Ravnica]]. Formerly, they made up one of the two elite classes of the [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]], the other being the [[Teratogen|teratogens]]. They are presided over by their "Matka", a high priestess, who until recently was [[Savra vod Savo|Savra]]. The current Matka is [[Izoni]], Thousand-Eyed. The Devkarin are adept spellcasters counting most of the Golgari's shamans among their numbers. Some of the Devkarin wear Moodmarks, which are minor enchantments that appear as spots or markings on their foreheads and around their eyes (usually resembling insect eyes).
