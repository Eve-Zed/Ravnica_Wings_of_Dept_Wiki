Within the [[Boros Legion|Boros]], angels are considered to be incarnations of the spirit of justice and revenge. They are considered to be the top members of the guild, whose [[parun]] [[Razia]] is an angel herself. Razia created all other Boros angels as clones, reflections, or copies of herself. They all lived in the floating hall called the [[Parhelion]].

Boros angels possess no need to drink, eat, or sleep, but can if it so pleases them. They have enhanced strength, a strong sense of duty and morality, and are supposedly incapable of lying. Boros angels can hear people calling their names from anywhere in [[Ravnica]].

The only surviving first-generation angel is [[Feather]], who became the Guildmaster after Razia's death. Following in her progenitor's footsteps, Feather created a new lineage of angels. Feather was later replaced by one of these Angels, [[Aurelia]], who argued that a disgraced angel can't command authority or respect. They have only two wings, unlike the original generation which had four wings.
