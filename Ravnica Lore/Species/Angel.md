Angel is a creature type used for humanoid beings with large, sometimes feathered, wings on their backs. Angels possess no need to drink, eat, or sleep, but can if it so pleases them.

[[Razia]] the [[Boros Legion|Boros]] [[parun]] created all other angels as clones, reflections, or copies of herself. They all lived in the floating hall called the [[Parhelion]].

In the wake of Aurelia's leadership and her assaults on parts of the Ravnican population that she deemed complicit in crimes, several angels left the Boros and dedicated themselves to the protection of the [[The Guildless|guildless]].
