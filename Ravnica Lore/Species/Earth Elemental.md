Primal spirits merge with rocks and minerals to form earth elementals. These beings possess powerful limbs and coarse features, sometimes studded with ore, gems, crystals, colorful striations, or living plants. Earth elementals often serve those who conjure them, or they appear in regions influenced by elemental magic, such as crystalline nodes, energetic fault lines, or veins of magical ore. Earth elementals effortlessly move through stone and can bring ruin to whole structures with their mighty fists.

Earth elementals are typically made of more than dirt. While an elemental's composition doesn't change its statistics or have monetary value, it makes each elemental distinct.

Earth Elemental Compositions can consist of:
- Colorful mineral formations.
- Cooled magma in melted heaps.
- Grass, moss, or plant roots.
- Heaps of peat or decaying matter.
- Mounds of sand studded with shells.
- Rubble or pieces of a ruined structure.
- Striking striations or bands of color.
- Veins of iron or other ore.
