Drakes are similar to [[Dragon|dragons]], though they lack any ability to breathe fire and have only two legs in addition to their huge wings.

Torch Drakes and Drake Familiars live among the spires of the vast city of [[Ravnica]]. They become especially voracious as they prepare for their autumn migration, hunting the city’s thoroughfares from dawn to dusk. The drakes are used by the [[House Dimir|Dimir]] and [[Izzet League|Izzet]] guilds. Also, the [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] used to capture drakes to show off. [[Leafdrakes]] are an enhanced form of drake created by the [[Simic Combine|Simic]]. Recently, among Simic [[krasis]], there are the Drakewing Krasis, drake-lizard hybrids.
