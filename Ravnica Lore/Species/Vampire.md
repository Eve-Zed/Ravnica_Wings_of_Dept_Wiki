Vampires are creatures of the night, they are ageless [[Undead|undead]] beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.
# Blood Drinker Vampire
Plenty of blood drinkers haunt [[Ravnica]]'s alleys and sewers, preying on those who are foolish enough to leave the relative safety of the crowds.

Vampires thrive in the [[Orzhov Syndicate]], where they can collect tithes and payments from their debtors in the form of blood. Their [[Undead|undead]] nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the oligarch [[Spirit|spirits]], but they remain capable of experiencing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast to [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]] [[Spirit|spirits]], they also retain their personalities, which are almost uniformly cruel.

Consuming a creature's blood creates a sort of empathetic bond that allows the blood drinker vampire to exert some magical influence over its victim.

# Mind Drinker Vampire
When vampires join [[House Dimir]], they can learn to siphon mental energy and memories along with the blood of their victims. They also study the magic favoured by Dimir [[House Dimir#Mind Mage|mind mages]], giving them a powerful combination of abilities ideal for espionage and infiltration.

The founder of [[House Dimir]], [[Szadek]], was the first of the so-called mind drinkers. His secrets are passed on only to other members of his guild, and mind drinkers who leave House Dimir become enemies of the guild-the only exceptions to a rule that prohibits mind drinkers from feeding on others of their kind.

Thanks to their particular gifts, mind drinkers are often placed as leaders of small cells of covert [[House Dimir|Dimir]] operatives. They rarely trust their own agents, though, and often follow their cell members to make sure those members carry out missions as ordered. The most suspicious vampires might even siphon thoughts from their subordinates to detect any hint of betrayal.
