Ragebeasts often have the Reckless and Siege Monster traits:

Reckless. At the start of its turn, the ragebeast can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

Siege Monster. The ragebeast deals double damage to objects and structures.
