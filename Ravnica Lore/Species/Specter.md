Specters are bodiless, life-devouring [[Spirit|spirits]] drawn to darkness and negative emotions. Having lost all connection to the beings they once were, these hateful spirits drain mortal essence to steal fleeting tastes of life and warmth.

Specters seek creatures and locations that exude evil and feed on the suffering they inspire. Specters lurk near
- A community afflicted by curses, grudges, plagues, or tragedies.
- An evil Artefact or a deadly magical device.
- The lair of a [[Fiend]] or an [[Undead]].
- The place where a villain died or is buried.
- The sanctuary of a necromancer or death cult.
- A secluded monument binding wicked souls.
- The site of a disaster or mass death.
# Nightveil Specter
The Nightveil specters are hooded, undead guardians that ride flying creatures called [[Gloamwing|gloamwings]]. They are fearsome agents of [[House Dimir]], protecting the territory and interests of that guild-particularly the neighbourhood of [[Nightveil]], from which the specters get their name. Their work can include driving off people who accidentally wander too close to a secret rooftop meeting, killing those who knowingly infiltrate Dimir property, and tracking those who have stolen guild secrets, then wiping those secrets from their victims' minds to ensure that they are never shared.

A Nightveil specter is created when the [[House Dimir#Mind Mage|mind magic]] of House Dimir erases a person's identity, leaving a mind so broken it can no longer live. Thus, Nightveil specters have no memory of their previous lives, and they are just clever enough to follow their orders with some amount of creativity. They pursue their assigned tasks with fearless determination.

If a gloamwing is killed, its specter becomes fixated on destroying those responsible. If the specter survives, it can create a new gloamwing over the course of a month, during which time the specter is [[Incapacitated]].
