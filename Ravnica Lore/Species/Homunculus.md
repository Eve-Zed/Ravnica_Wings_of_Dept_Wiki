Homunculi (Latin: "little person") are artificially made, but sentient and living, miniature humans. These creatures are used for menial or dangerous tasks. Many homunculi just have one cyclopic eye.

The homunculi of [[Ravnica]] are less human-like, and more imp-like. They can't speak but do communicate with sign language and in written form. Ravnican homunculi don't have vowels in their names.
