Birds of prey of fantastic scale, rocs hunt over vast territories and can snatch whole elephants, whales, or wagons in their talons. They then carry their prey back to their remote nests, journeys that can take days and cover hundreds of miles.

Rocs nest amid remote heights. Their nests are typically littered with treasure and uneaten prey. A Rocs nest may hold:
- The burial litter of a lost hero.
- A caravan wagon full of trade goods.
- A live elephant.
- eggs larger than adult [[humans]].
- Someone marooned in the nest.
- A statue of a knight riding a rearing steed.
# Skyjek Rocs
The aerial forces of the [[Boros Legion]] - skyknights who fly alongside the [[Angel|angels]] - take to the air mounted on Skyjek rocs. These avians are named for the skyknights who are also part of the [[Wojek League]], called Skyjeks. From the backs of their rocs, these mounted soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions, bombard enemies on the ground, and engage flying foes.

The shape of a Skyjek roc's body makes it relatively easy to saddle and ride, and it is typically equipped with armor plating on its head and chest.

Skyjek rocs are headstrong and impulsive, but their bravery makes them ideal mounts for the Boros knights.
