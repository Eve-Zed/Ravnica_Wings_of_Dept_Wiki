Not a naturally-occurring race on [[Ravnica]], flame-kin are created via magic, made to wear armor and serve as soldiers in the [[Boros Legion]]. Passionate zealots loyal to the Boros cause, these fire [[Elemental|elementals]] have been blessed by the Boros [[Angel|Angels]]. Flame-kin eventually dissipate, like wildfires without any oxygen or fuel, as their power and existence burn out when a battle or war is finished. Flame-kin are strengthened by magic; though formidable on their own, the application of enchantments grants them devastating power.

Flame-kin resemble humans made of solid, blazing flame. They wear only black armor made by guild smiths.
