**Ravnica** is a [[Plane]] whose main planet is covered in a large city, which has the same name: Ravnica. It takes its flavour from that of Eastern Europe and Slavic folklore, most notably 15th-century Prague.
# History of Ravnica
For millennia, cities covered the plane's surface, until eventually, they ran together into one vast megalopolis.
## The Erstwhile
A delicate and sophisticated race of [[Elf|elves]] known as the [[Erstwhile]] once was an important faction in Ravnica. They were laid to rest in coffins in [[Umerilek]], Mausoleum of the Erstwhile.
## Government and law: Guildpact
Almost ten thousand years before the events of Ravnica, the plane of Ravnica boasted untold violence and brutality, with various factions constantly waging centuries-long war against each other. Realising that this never ending war would ultimately destroy everything, a council between ten factions was held, where the leader [[Azor I]] suggested establishing a living, breathing enchantment that would end the violence and ensure the survival of the factions. While some of the order-phobic factions had initial disagreements, the other nine leaders eventually concurred that such a pact was the best chance of survival. Each of the ten factions signed the [[Guildpact]], and over time, these factions became the [[Ravnican guilds|ten guilds of Ravnica]].

The power of the Guildpact was subtle; it prevented any guild from dabbling into the business of any other guild or disturbing the stable power balance among the ten by twisting circumstance and coincidence to nullify the disruptive guild's actions. While the Guildpact was credited with bringing relative peace and prosperity to the plane, sporadic clashes between guilds still occurred. Despite any conflicts between the guilds at a particular time though, the anniversary of the Guildpact's signing was celebrated every year with a day-long festival, where all the people laid down their weapons and made merry. This celebration was called The Festival of the Guildpact.

Not all of Ravnica's citizens are a member of a guild; about half of the population is guildless. However, the guilds are a required part of daily life, and their presence is felt everywhere on Ravnica.
## The Decamillennial
During the Decamillennial Celebration of 10,000 ZC, the Guildpact was broken. The ancient balance was shattered, and Ravnica was thrown into chaos.
## The Interregnum
It came to pass that the guilds were officially disbanded. Many of the guilds were forcefully torn down due to the long-simmering unrest the guildless held towards their masters. There were, however, remainders of the guilds present.
## Return of the guilds
The former guilds, however, were not long to rest, and they reestablished, many under new leadership. Some adopted a new purpose, as the original Guildpact had bound them to a specific task for over ten thousand years, and the Guildless had grown weary of some of their morally questionable activities. Most guilds, however, follow the same basic structure they always had, as habit and traditions are forces at least as strong as the Guildpact.
## The Guildpact reinstated
In 10,075 ZC, the [[Niv-Mizzet|Izzet guildmaster]] discovered that [[Azor I]] had created a contingency plan that would take effect if the magic of the Guildpact was ever broken. An intricate network of [[Leyline|leylines]] sprawled across the districts Ravnica called the [[Implicit Maze]], offered a test to the guilds. If they would cooperate to solve the maze, they would secure the power of a new Guildpact. That power was eventually bestowed upon [[Jace Beleren]], who became the Living Guildpact. Any law that he verbally confirms becomes legally binding.
