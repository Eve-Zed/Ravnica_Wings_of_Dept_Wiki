An [[Lawmage|advokist]] is one of the [[Orzhov Syndicate|syndicate]]'s lawyers, with duties that include overseeing contracts, representing clients in [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]] courts, and prosecuting those who fail to pay their debts.

Many advokists draw on the power of law magic to enforce regulations and contracts to the advantage of the guild. They use their magic to draw out the truth from debtors and those who dare to break their contracts with the guild, to ensure that petitioners approach with the proper humility, and to punish those who offend them or violate their contracts. Some advokists also deal in encrypting texts, warding vaults and secret meeting rooms, fortifying structures, and cloaking important personages in magical protections.
