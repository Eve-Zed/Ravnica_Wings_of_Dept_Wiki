Aurelia is the current guildmaster of the [[Boros Legion]].

Aurelia is tall but gives an impression of delicate grace that belies her size. Unlike her predecessors, she has only two white-feathered wings. They spread nearly ten feet across. Aurelia's features are striking, androgynous, and beautiful, and her bright crimson hair flows down over her shoulder like a river of blood dripping across her well-worn armor. Her voice is surprisingly high and musical.

Unlike the former guild leader [[Razia]], the [[parun]] of the Boros, Aurelia keeps a close relationship with her guildmembers. During the years of her leadership, she has shown a strong appreciation for the ordinary citizens who are often caught in the middle of interguild violence. True justice, Aurelia argues, isn't merely enforcing the letter of existing laws (let the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]] fret over that), but establishing equitable and compassionate relationships among all of [[Ravnica]]'s people. That means protecting the weak from the depredations of the strong, sheltering the innocents who are threatened by war, and ensuring that enforcement of the law doesn't become oppressive. Aurelia actively supports efforts to establish a lasting peace among the guilds in the absence of the [[Guildpact]]. Aurelia prefers to lead the Boros Legion from the front. She brings swift and unrelenting punishment to the wicked; her temper is legendary.

[[Feather]] was the last angel after the genocide perpetrated by [[Szadek]] and was selected, mainly by default, to lead the Boros after the collapse of the first Guildpact. Part of her efforts included repopulating the [[Firemane Angel|Firemane]] with new angels, one of which was Aurelia. However, Feather's baggage and past were seen unfavorably by her strong-willed progeny, and so Aurelia ascended to the leadership of the Boros not long before 10,074 ZC.
