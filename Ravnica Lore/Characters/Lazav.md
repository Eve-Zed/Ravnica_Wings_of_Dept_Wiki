Lazav is uniquely qualified to be the [[House Dimir|Dimir]] guildmaster: he is a [[Shapeshifter|shapechanger]] whose mysterious genius is informed by agents from the entire Dimir network. He takes on a tremendous variety of guises as his needs and plans require. He might step out into the Ravnican streets as an elderly widow to eavesdrop at the bazaar, become a [[Vedalken|vedalken]] hussar of the [[Azorius Senate]] to sidestep a checkpoint, or transform into a [[Tin Street]] merchant to deceive a passing noble. His true form might be that of a doppelganger or some other creature; no one has ever seen it.
