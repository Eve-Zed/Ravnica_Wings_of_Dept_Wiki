Pierakor az Vinrenn D'rav, better known as Feather, is a [[Boros Legion|Boros]] [[Firemane Angel]], who spent much time as [[Agrus Kos]]'s partner.

Feather was placed in the [[Wojek League|League of Wojek]] to work off a holy debt, and her wings were bound until her service with the Wojeks was considered appeased. After the events of the [[Guildpact#Decamillennial Celebration|Decamillennial]], Kos freed her wings and she vanished, looking for the missing [[Parhelion]].

She reappeared when she sensed Kos's death. She was chosen as one of his pallbearers but vanished again shortly after. Her whereabouts during all those years were finally explained when she came to submit herself for arrest when it was revealed that she was the last surviving of the Boros angels, the rest having been killed by [[Szadek]]'s ghost army. After the dissolution of the guildpact, she was named as the Boros Guildmaster.

Even before becoming the Guildmaster, she possessed a small personal fortune due to [[Pivlic]]'s excellent management of her salary as a wojek (she never spent it, since she didn't have expenses).

Her tenure as Guildmaster was challenged by [[Aurelia]] (one of her creations), who believed that no angel who had been disgraced had a right to rule. She garnered much support in her crusade and Feather was imprisoned until her final fate could be decided.
