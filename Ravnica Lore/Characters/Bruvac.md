As a judge of the [[Azorius Senate]], Bruvac is expected to have a comprehensive knowledge of Ravinican law and bureaucracy. Not only has Bruvac exceeded that expectation, one could argue that he has weaponized it. "To slip a loophole past Bruvac" is an Azorius saying that means "to do the impossible".
