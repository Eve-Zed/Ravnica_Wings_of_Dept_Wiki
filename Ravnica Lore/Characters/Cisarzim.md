The [[cyclops]] Cisarzim is allegedly the ancestor of [[Borborygmos]], the guildmaster of the [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]. Although his fate is not detailed, it is known that he died, as [[Svogthir]], the [[parun]] of the [[Golgari Swarm]], integrated Cisarzim's torso into his corpse.

Cisarzim was noted for having wielded an axe known as "Skullhammer".
