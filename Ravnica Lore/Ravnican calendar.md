[[Ravnica]]'s year of 365 days is made up of twelve months, each of which has the same number of days as its counterpart in the Gregorian calendar. The year begins with 1 Seleszeni, which corresponds to March 1.

The signing of the Guildpact marked the beginning of the modern Ravnican calendar. Years prior to that pivotal event are denoted as "Al Concordant," or AC, and counted backward from 1 AC. Years after the signing are "Zal Concordant," ZC. The current date is 10,076 ZC, usually referred to as '76.

The annual celebration of the Guildpact begins on 28 Zuun and extends overnight into 1 Seleszeni.
