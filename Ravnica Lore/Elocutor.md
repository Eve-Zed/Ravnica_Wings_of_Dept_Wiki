A skilled orator and diplomat, can put their talents to use in the guild as an elocutor. The [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]] are known for their measured, patient speech, and the elocutors are the primary voice through which the senate communicates with the other guilds and the people of Ravnica. Thus, they serve as an emissary from the Azorius to another guild, working to settle trade or territorial agreements, temporary alliances, and the like. They have the task of securing the support of key senators for a particular piece of legislation or treaty. Well-established elocutors can be rewarded with the rank of scribe or emissary.
