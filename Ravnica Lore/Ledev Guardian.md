The Ledev Guardians ("Knights of the Road") is an order of Knights, who were sworn to defend routes of commerce and travel on the plane of [[Ravnica]].

Ledev guardians are skilled in fighting with both bows and swords on foot and while mounted on large intelligent [[Wolf|wolves]] the size of bears. They share a deep bond with their wolves that is often mistaken for telepathy. Ledev are also capable of performing a limited "lay on hands" style of healing magic. The Ledev Guardians count at least [[Elf|Elves]], [[Human|Humans]] and [[Centaur|Centaurs]] among their ranks but possibly also include members of other races.

The Order is descended from an ancient order of warrior monks of Ravnica from before the [[Guildpact#Singing of the Guildpact|signing of the Guildpact]] who would wander the roads righting wrongs and solving injustices for no reason other than their belief in right and wrong.

Though the Ledev Guardians were originally an independent organization, they were eventually brought into the [[Selesnya Conclave]] and have been converted to the Selesnyan worship of life. It is noted that the Ledev in recent times have been spending more and more of their time guarding Selesnyan officials, interests, and territory and less time patrolling the roads of Ravnica for the good of all, a trend that left many Ledev Guardians concerned for the future of their order.

[[Tolsimir Wolfblood]] is the current leader of the Order.
