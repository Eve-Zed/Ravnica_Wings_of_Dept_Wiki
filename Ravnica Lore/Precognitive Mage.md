Precognitive mages are wizards from the [[Azorius Senate]] on [[Ravnica]], who can gain foreknowledge of a future event. They experience their gift as a series of runes hovering in midair.
Spell casters with some ability to glimpse the future, can use this ability to try to prevent crime before it occurs, serving as a precognitive mage. These mages occupy a small niche on the periphery of the guild, and the guild hasn't developed a bureaucratic structure to accommodate them, so they advance through the same ranks as lawmages.
