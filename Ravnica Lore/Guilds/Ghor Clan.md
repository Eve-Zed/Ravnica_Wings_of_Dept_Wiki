The Ghor clan is led by an [[ettin]] named [[Ruric Thar]] (or, perhaps more properly, Ruric and Thar, since the heads claim separate names). Of all [[Gruul Clans|the clans]], the Ghor carry out the most frequent and savage assaults on [[Ravnica]]'s citizenry. The clan is known for its audacity in forging encampments close to heavily populated districts.
