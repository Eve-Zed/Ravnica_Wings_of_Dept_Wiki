> _Officer Lavinia stood before the enormous double doors that led into the highest spire of New Prahv, the lair of the guildmaster. To look at her, nothing would seem out of place: her cape spilled elegantly from her officer's armour, her sword shone like a decorative piece one would hang above a mantel, and her three-sided medals displayed her district-spanning rank._

Bringing order from chaos—that is the mission of the Azorius Senate. Without the extensive legal code crafted and enforced by the Azorius, society would crumble, transforming [[Ravnica]] into a field of rubble where the [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] and the [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] do whatever they please. The Azorius carry this weighty responsibility with stoic pride, and they perform their work of legislation, investigation, and enforcement with steely determination.

The first guildmaster of the Azorius Senate was a sphinx named [[Azor I|Azor]]. He was the author of the original Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate contingency plan that resulted in the creation of the [[Jace Beleren|Living Guildpact]]. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.

# Inside the Senate
The Azorius Senate is supported by three branches, called columns, each led by an arbiter (also called a capital). The capitals of the three columns form the Triumvirate, which advises the guildmaster, [[Isperia|Supreme Judge Isperia]], an ancient and wise sphinx.
## The Sova Column 
It consists of judges and the extensive legal apparatus surrounding them. It is tasked with adjudicating and arbitrating the effects of the law. The column employs legal aides, pages, librarians, experts on precedent, advocates for the accused, public prosecutors, and judges. The arbiter of the Sova Column is [[Leonos II]].
## The Jelenn Column
This column writes and enacts the laws of Ravnica, involving the efforts not just of the designated legislators like senators, but also a network of bureaucrats: aides, writers, researchers, lobbyists, clerks, and so on. The Jelenn Column is led by a [[Vedalken]] [[lawmage]] named [[Uzana]].
## The Lyev Column
The Lyev Column enforces the law as Ravnica's police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, lawmages and ministers. The Azorius military, which belongs to this Column, can be broadly separated into hussars (mounted soldiers) and infantry. Arresters specialise in preventing or stopping things from happening. The Lyev Column is also venturing into the work of managing surveillance and precognition. The hussar commander [[Agmand Sarv]] is the arbiter of the Lyev Column.
## Goals of the Azorius
The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of society. They want to protect the people of [[Ravnica]] and foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates. Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the highest virtue is a society built on stability and order, and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check, but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force that stifles freedom and expression.

In the absence of the [[Jace Beleren|Living Guildpact]], the Azorius are uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among the [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]]. As a group, they are convinced that the system can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the reality that the one person who is meant to hold their world together never seems to be around. The Azorius Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wielding an ever-growing amount of influence.

The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civilization can be saved only through the guidance of a strong, safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius, the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and preserve the force of law.

The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the [[Gruul Clans]] and imposed a variety of creatively written laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical shows of the [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] (in part because the Azorius are frequently ridiculed by Rakdos performers) and attempt to curb them with new decrees about public performances. In response to attempts by other guilds to edge their way around the system, the Azorius routinely create new laws to support or countermand old ones.
# Azorius Members
Most creatures associated with the Azorius Senate are humanoids (largely [[Human|humans]] and [[Vedalken|vedalken]]) and various others that serve as familiars, pets, and mounts. Owls are popular familiars, since they are viewed as symbols of wisdom and sound judgment. [[Sphinx|Sphinxes]] and [[Archon|archons]] are the rare nonhumanoids that play a significant role in the leadership and operation of the guild.

Azorius [[Lawmage|lawmages]] craft one-eyed [[Homunculus|homunculi]] to perform menial tasks in Azorius buildings.
## Joining the Azorius Senate
As a recruit to the Azorius Senate, you were quickly immersed in the law. You might have clerked for a judge or a legislator, been an apprentice to a practitioner of law magic, studied rhetoric with diplomats, or trained to patrol the streets and enforce the law. As your training comes to an end and your adventuring career begins, you must decide whether to focus on law enforcement or to operate primarily within the bureaucracy of the senate.
## Law Enforcement
Most Azorius adventurers belong to the guild's police force. They are soldiers or spellcasters who patrol the city in teams or singly, preventing crimes or stopping them in progress. If you want to pursue a career in law enforcement, choose the path of the lawmage, the precognitive mage, or the arrester.
### [[Lawmage|Lawmages]]
As a spellcaster in the Azorius Senate, you use your magic to compel or restrain malefactors and scofflaws. You might also use your magic to protect Azorius soldiers and innocent bystanders from harm. In any case, you're called a lawmage, and you can aspire to the title of justiciar and then deputy as your standing within the guild increases.
### [[Precognitive Mage|Precognitive Mages]]
If you are a spellcaster with some ability to glimpse the future, you can use this ability to try to prevent crime before it occurs, serving as a precognitive mage. These mages occupy a small niche on the periphery of the guild, and the guild hasn't developed a bureaucratic structure to accommodate them, so they advance through the same ranks as lawmages.
### Arresters
As a martial character, you can serve as an arrester in the Azorius Senate. Arresters maintain the peace by removing threats—both actual and potential—identified through regular patrols, citizen reports, and occasionally alerts from the Precognitive Mage|precognitive mages. As you gain the respect of your superiors, you can be promoted to the rank of officer or imperator.
## Bureaucracy
Bureaucracy might seem like the opposite of adventure, but it is possible to immerse yourself in the life of a civil servant in the Azorius Senate and still live an adventurous life. You might be a mild-mannered judge's clerk or scribe who got caught up in a whirlwind chain of events beyond your control, or you might moonlight as a vigilante in defiance of the law you are supposed to uphold. Or you could serve a diplomatic function as an elocutor.
### Elocutors
As a skilled orator and diplomat, you can put your talents to use in the guild as an elocutor. The Azorius are known for their measured, patient speech, and the elocutors are the primary voice through which the senate communicates with the other guilds and the people of Ravnica. Thus, you might serve as an emissary from the Azorius to another guild, working to settle trade or territorial agreements, temporary alliances, and the like. You might have the task of securing the support of key senators for a particular piece of legislation or treaty. Well-established elocutors can be rewarded with the rank of scribe or emissary.
# Enemies and Allies
As far as the Azorius are concerned, every other guild in Ravnica is hastening along the road to anarchy. Even other guilds that are inclined toward order (such as the [[Boros Legion|Boros]], [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]], and [[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]) are ignoring or exploiting the law.

You participate in missions to thwart the criminals of other guilds, from overzealous Boros vigilantes to insidious [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] assassins. [[House Dimir|Dimir]] spies, Orzhov extortionists, and bloodthirsty [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] performers keep Azorius peacekeepers busy enough, without the added complications of reckless [[Izzet League|Izzet]] and [[Simic Combine|Simic]] experiments putting the citizenry in danger.

Of course, whenever the members of another guild decide to operate within the law, they are potential allies for the Azorius. Even some members of the Cult of Rakdos can be pragmatic enough to stifle their impulses for a time in order to join forces against a common enemy.
## The Azorius View on Other Guilds
Because of its authoritarian, overreaching grasp, the Azorius Senate's relationships with other guilds are rarely positive. Azorius members tend to view members of other guilds as dangerous threats to order, while other guild members see the Azorius as rigid and tyrannical.

- **[[Boros Legion|Boros]].** "Their vigilantism is tremendously dangerous without a hand to control it."

- **[[House Dimir|Dimir]]**. "A perennial thorn in our side. Though they were once our greatest foes, not even the masters of espionage can hide from our watchful eyes."

- **[[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]]**. "Their underground structures break numerous building regulations, but at least they fulfil their duties as garbage collectors."

- **[[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]**. "The Gruul are dangerous anarchists with no interest in furthering the development of civilisation. They serve no useful purpose."

- **[[Izzet League|Izzet]]**. "Eccentric and occasionally explosive, but generally harmless, for now. In their paranoia they have enlarged their weapon stockpiles, but they lack the clarity of vision to put them to use."

- **[[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]**. "Their brazen exploitation of our laws will be their downfall. They are an insidious threat that could tear society apart from the inside."

- **[[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]**. "An absolute blight on Ravnica. They are clowns who know nothing of culture and exist only to torment the functioning members of society."

- **[[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]**. "The Conclave plays by the rules and keeps to itself. Until its members become too numerous, they are of little threat to us."

- **[[Simic Combine|Simic]]**. "The Simic experiment with matters that disobey the laws of nature and the laws of Ravnica. We must not let them gain influence."
