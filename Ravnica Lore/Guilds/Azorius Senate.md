The Azorius Senate is the white/blue guild from [[Ravnica]]. They represent the executive, legislative and judicative force. Their ideals are Law and Order above all else.
![[Pasted image 20251007173842.png]]
Bringing order from chaos—that is the mission of the Azorius Senate. Without the extensive legal code crafted and enforced by the Azorius, society would crumble, transforming [[Ravnica]] into a field of rubble where the [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] and the [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] do whatever they please. The Azorius carry this weighty responsibility with stoic pride, and they perform their work of legislation, investigation, and enforcement with steely determination.

The first guildmaster of the Azorius Senate was a sphinx named [[Azor I|Azor]]. He was the author of the original Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate contingency plan that resulted in the creation of the [[Jace Beleren|Living Guildpact]]. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.

# Inside the Senate
The Azorius Senate is supported by three branches, called columns, each led by an arbiter (also called a capital). The capitals of the three columns form the Triumvirate, which advises the guildmaster, [[Isperia|Supreme Judge Isperia]], an ancient and wise sphinx.

## Goals of the Azorius
The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of society. They want to protect the people of [[Ravnica]] and foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates. Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the highest virtue is a society built on stability and order, and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check, but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force that stifles freedom and expression.

In the absence of the [[Jace Beleren|Living Guildpact]], the Azorius are uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among the [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]]. As a group, they are convinced that the system can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the reality that the one person who is meant to hold their world together never seems to be around. The Azorius Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wielding an ever-growing amount of influence.

The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civilisation can be saved only through the guidance of a strong, safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius, the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and preserve the force of law.

The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the [[Gruul Clans]] and imposed a variety of creatively written laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical shows of the [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] (in part because the Azorius are frequently ridiculed by Rakdos performers) and attempt to curb them with new decrees about public performances. In response to attempts by other guilds to edge their way around the system, the Azorius routinely create new laws to support or countermand old ones.
# History
# Azorius Members
## Species and Creatures
Most creatures associated with the Azorius Senate are [[Humanoid|humanoids]] (largely [[Human|humans]] and [[Vedalken|vedalken]]) and various others that serve as familiars, pets, and mounts. [[Owl|Owls]] are popular familiars, since they are viewed as symbols of wisdom and sound judgement. [[Sphinx|Sphinxes]] and [[Archon|archons]] are the rare non-humanoids that play a significant role in the leadership and operation of the guild.

Azorius [[Lawmage|lawmages]] craft one-eyed [[Homunculus|homunculi]] to perform menial tasks in Azorius buildings.

## Classes and Roles
Recruits to the Azorius Senate are quickly immersed in the law. They might have clerked for a judge or a legislator, been an apprentice to a practitioner of law magic, studied rhetoric with diplomats, or trained to patrol the streets and enforce the law. As their training comes to an end they decide whether to focus on law enforcement or to operate primarily within the bureaucracy of the senate.
### Law Enforcement
The Azorius Law Enforcement consists of soldiers and spell casters who patrol the city in teams or singly, preventing crimes or stopping them in progress. Those who pursue a career in law enforcement, choose the path of the lawmage, the precognitive mage, or the arrester.

### Bureaucracy
Bureaucracy might seem like the opposite of adventure, but it is possible to immerse oneself in the life of a civil servant in the Azorius Senate and still live an adventurous life. They are a mild-mannered judge's clerk or scribe who got caught up in a whirlwind chain of events beyond your control, or moonlight as a vigilante in defiance of the law you are supposed to uphold. Or they can serve a diplomatic function as an elocutor.

# Enemies and Allies
As far as the Azorius are concerned, every other guild in Ravnica is hastening along the road to anarchy. Even other guilds that are inclined toward order (such as the [[Boros Legion|Boros]], [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]], and [[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]) are ignoring or exploiting the law.

You participate in missions to thwart the criminals of other guilds, from overzealous Boros vigilantes to insidious [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] assassins. [[House Dimir|Dimir]] spies, Orzhov extortionists, and bloodthirsty [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]] performers keep Azorius peacekeepers busy enough, without the added complications of reckless [[Izzet League|Izzet]] and [[Simic Combine|Simic]] experiments putting the citizenry in danger.

Of course, whenever the members of another guild decide to operate within the law, they are potential allies for the Azorius. Even some members of the Cult of Rakdos can be pragmatic enough to stifle their impulses for a time in order to join forces against a common enemy.
## The Azorius View on Other Guilds
Because of its authoritarian, overreaching grasp, the Azorius Senate's relationships with other guilds are rarely positive. Azorius members tend to view members of other guilds as dangerous threats to order, while other guild members see the Azorius as rigid and tyrannical.

- **[[Boros Legion|Boros]].** "Their vigilantism is tremendously dangerous without a hand to control it."

- **[[House Dimir|Dimir]]**. "A perennial thorn in our side. Though they were once our greatest foes, not even the masters of espionage can hide from our watchful eyes."

- **[[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]]**. "Their underground structures break numerous building regulations, but at least they fulfil their duties as garbage collectors."

- **[[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]**. "The Gruul are dangerous anarchists with no interest in furthering the development of civilisation. They serve no useful purpose."

- **[[Izzet League|Izzet]]**. "Eccentric and occasionally explosive, but generally harmless, for now. In their paranoia they have enlarged their weapon stockpiles, but they lack the clarity of vision to put them to use."

- **[[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]**. "Their brazen exploitation of our laws will be their downfall. They are an insidious threat that could tear society apart from the inside."

- **[[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]**. "An absolute blight on Ravnica. They are clowns who know nothing of culture and exist only to torment the functioning members of society."

- **[[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]**. "The Conclave plays by the rules and keeps to itself. Until its members become too numerous, they are of little threat to us."

- **[[Simic Combine|Simic]]**. "The Simic experiment with matters that disobey the laws of nature and the laws of Ravnica. We must not let them gain influence."
