The paruns were the founders of the ten [[Ravnican guilds]] and, during the [[Guildpact#Singing of the Guildpact|Signing of the Guildpact]], they became the signatories of the original [[Guildpact]]. As most were exceptionally long-lived beings, a majority remained active in some form after ten millennia, though not all continued as guildmaster of their respective guild.
