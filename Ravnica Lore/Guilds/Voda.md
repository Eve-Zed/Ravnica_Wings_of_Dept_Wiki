In the [[Selesnya Conclave]] a [[Dryad|dryad]], called a voda, is called forth from that central tree to be the leader of the community.
A voda is accessible to all the guild members in her care. You have regular contact with your voda, who knows your name and has a good idea of your interests, goals, and strengths. And since your voda is mystically linked to the guildmaster, [[Trostani]], through communion with the Worldsoul, it's safe to assume that Trostani knows who you are as well.
