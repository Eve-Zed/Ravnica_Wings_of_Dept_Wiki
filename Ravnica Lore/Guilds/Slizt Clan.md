The Slizt clan is a clutch of sly, skittish warriors, consisting largely of reptilian [[humanoids]] called [[Viashino]], along with a few wily [[Human|humans]]. This clan survives in the [[rubblebelts]] by taking up hiding places in high ground and ambushing its enemies with ranged attacks from above. Other [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] regard the Slizt as skulkers and cowards, but nonetheless all are cautious when entering areas with elevated ruins. The home ground of the Slizt clan is [[the Husk]], an area at the center of a vast rubblebelt featuring many large, ancient structures that have remained standing for generations.
