The most selective of all the [[Gruul Clans]], the Bolrac clan denies membership to the smaller races. Its members are all enormous, lumbering brutes, primarily [[cyclopes]], [[ogres]], and [[Giant|giants]]. The clan's leadership changes frequently—sometimes daily, since battles for supremacy are as common as meals. The Bolrac clan specializes in bringing down massive structures using mauls and battering rams. The only thing the Bolrac love more than destroying something smaller than them is toppling, overrunning, and destroying something larger than them.
