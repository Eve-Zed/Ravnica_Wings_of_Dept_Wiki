The Lyev Column is one of the Columns in [[Azorius Senate]]. it enforces the law as Ravnica's police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, lawmages and ministers. The Azorius military, which belongs to this Column, can be broadly separated into hussars (mounted soldiers) and infantry. Arresters specialise in preventing or stopping things from happening. The Lyev Column is also venturing into the work of managing surveillance and precognition. The hussar commander [[Agmand Sarv]] is the arbiter of the Lyev Column.
