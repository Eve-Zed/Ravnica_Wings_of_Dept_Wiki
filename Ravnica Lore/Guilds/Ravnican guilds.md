The **Guilds of Ravnica** are ten sociopolitical factions that hold power on the city plane of [[Ravnica]]. Each guild has its own distinct ideology that unifies its members with one another, with the guild itself, with its functions and purposes, and with its structure.

# The ten guilds

- [[Azorius Senate]] (white/blue) The Azorius Senate functions as the government of Ravnica, built on the three columns of a legislative, a judicial, and an executive branch under the leadership of [[Isperia]], the sphinx Supreme Judge.
- [[House Dimir]] (blue/black) House Dimir is in the business of information, operating an espionage organisation behind a facade of messengers, investigators, and archivists. Its enigmatic leader, [[Lazav]], wears many faces.
- [[Cult of Rakdos]] (black/red) The demonic Cult of Rakdos is the jester in Ravnica's culture, using satire and performance to skewer the powerful and embolden the weak. But it is a cruel and bloodthirsty jester, in the manner of its demonic leader, and it supplements parody and levity with blood and fire.
- [[Gruul Clans]] (red/green) Raging against civilisation and its defilement of the natural world, the loose alliance of the Gruul Clans is led by the cyclops [[Borborygmos]].
- [[Selesnya Conclave]] (green/white)  The Selesnya Conclave is led by [[Trostani]], three dryads who are fused together with one another and with[[ Mat'Selesnya]], a manifestation of the soul of the world. The guild seeks to bring nature and the city into balance.
- [[Orzhov Syndicate]] (white/black) A sinister combination of church, bank, and organised crime syndicate, the Orzhov Syndicate is controlled by the [[Obzedat]], a cabal of ancient spirits often called the Ghost Council.
- [[Izzet League]] (blue/red) Led by the dragon[[ Niv-Mizzet]], the Izzet League is a guild of scientists and engineers who build and sustain Ravnica's infrastructure while conducting wild experiments in magic—efforts that usually involve barely controlled elemental energy.
- [[Golgari Swarm]] (black green) An elf lich named [[Jarad vod Savo|Jarad]] guides the Golgari Swarm's masses as they lurk in the undercity, where they process the city's waste and see to the new life that emerges from death and decay.
- [[Boros Legion]] (red/white) Led by the angel [[Aurelia]], the Boros Legion pursues the cause of justice, not merely law enforcement. Boros serves as Ravnica's standing army.
- [[Simic Combine]] (green/blue) Under the leadership of Prime Speaker [[Zegana]], the biomancers of the Simic Combine apply magic to the life sciences. Striving to create a harmonious future where creatures of all kinds are perfectly adapted to their ever-changing environment, the Simic magically hasten the process of evolution and adaptation of life.

These ten guilds stand as the foundation of power on [[Ravnica]]. Each maintains a distinctive identity and civic function, a diverse collection of creatures, and a subculture of its own. The guilds' history is a web of wars, intrigue, and political machinations stretching over the millennia during which they have vied for control of the world. Their roles were established thousands of years ago in a magical treaty called the [[Guildpact]], which not only assigned each guild a function, but also enforced an uneasy peace among them.

Citizens of Ravnica aren't born into guilds. An individual can choose to belong to any guild—or no guild. Some guilds, such as Selesnya and Boros, actively recruit new members, while others simply accept those who seek membership. People within a family might join different guilds, which can lead to strong connections between the guilds in question or to painful animosity in families whose members follow different paths.

Even though citizens can choose their guild associations, long-standing traditions steer certain individuals toward a particular guild. For example, it would be highly unusual for a Devkarin elf (a dark elf) to join any guild other than the Golgari, and the Ordruun line of minotaurs has provided the Boros armies with generations of offspring. Members of certain races are also drawn to specific guilds, as noted in the description of each of guild.
