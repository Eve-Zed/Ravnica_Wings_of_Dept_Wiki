The Boros Legion is the white/red guild from [[Ravnica]]. They represent the main military force of Ravnica. Their ideals are Justice and Strength above all else.
![[Pasted image 20251017012733.png]]
Clad in shining armor and fueled by righteous zeal, the soldiers of the Boros Legion take up steel against the corruption and lawlessness that gnaw at the soul of [[Ravnica]]. Combining the force of law with the military strength to back it up, the Boros work to forge Ravnica into a just society, a safe and healthy community for all. From garrisons throughout the sprawling city, disciplined, stalwart soldiers are dispatched to stand firm against [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] raids, [[House Dimir|Dimir]] infiltration, [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] corruption, and the subtle influence of more nefarious foes.

The [[Angel|archangel]] [[Razia]] was the original guildmaster of the Boros Legion, which was established to serve as Ravnica's standing army. Razia served as its guildmaster for almost ten thousand years. Legend says that all the other angels of Ravnica were created in the image of this semidivine figure, and her death was devastating to the guild. [[Aurelia]], the current angelic guildmaster, is the third to hold that title.

# Inside the Guild
Angels occupy the highest tier of the Boros hierarchy, from the guildmaster Aurelia down to the hosts of holy warriors and advisors in leadership roles. Their opinions and advice are deeply respected in the guild, though the [[Angel|angels]] aren't above engaging in the machinations of mortal politics. The angels include the wise, strategic warleaders; the holy champions and paragons of war known as [[Firemane Angel|firemanes]]; and battleforce angels, who form the bulk of the legion's angelic warriors.

From the perspective of the average Boros soldier, the angels embody the ideals the Boros hold dear. Few mortal soldiers gain admission into the presence of the warleaders and other powerful angels, but battleforce angels fight at the forefront of the legion's ranks, and they form strong friendships with mortals under such life-and-death circumstances. Boros paladins are the members most likely to converse with the angels and be charged with implementing their plans.

The garrison commanders who convey the angels' commands are accessible to the ordinary soldier. In addition to [[Sunhome]], the Boros maintain smaller garrisons throughout the [[Tenth District]], at least one in each of the six precincts.

## Goals of the Boros
Wherever criminals exploit others, petty tyrants make grabs for power, or violence erupts and leaves devastation in its wake, Boros soldiers are there fighting to make things right.

The Boros Legion is defined by the tension between its goal of establishing order and harmony and the fiery zeal that drives many of its members. The guild stands for peace and justice, which can be established only through the rule of law. Its moral stance is fundamentally good, as it strives to protect the innocent and powerless from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, members of the legion are passionate about their pursuit of justice, spurred by their righteous wrath into action against evil and injustice. Ironically, this means that individual members sometimes break the rules they are charged with enforcing, cleaving to the spirit of the law when the letter no longer serves justice.

Because the [[Guildpact]]—the one force on [[Ravnica]] that can keep the guilds from destroying each other—is now embodied in a single, unreliable person who vanishes for weeks or months at a time, the legion is in a heightened state of vigilance. In this time of uncertainty, the Boros are on constant alert for military threats. They work to maintain their fortifications to ensure that they aren't overrun by [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] marauders. Construction proceeds on new strongholds near Gruul territories, but in general the Boros prepare for a military threat the same way they always have—by fielding the stronger army.

The angels are also bracing for a subtler threat: the danger of infiltration by [[House Dimir]]. The Boros are becoming increasingly aware of the possibility that their guild could be undermined from within. Security at garrison buildings is vigilant, with angels watching the entrances at all times for spies.

## Species and Creatures
The Boros Legion employs many different creatures to swell the ranks of its soldiery. These creatures might serve as companions, guardians, or mounts. The upper ranks are made up of [[Angel|angels]], the lower ranks may include [[Human|humans]], [[Goblin|goblins]], [[Viashino|viashinos]], [[Elemental|elementals]] like [[Flame-Kin]], [[Giant|giants]], [[Minotaur|minotaurs]] and [[Roc|rocs]] and [[Griffin|griffins]] as mounts and dogs, especially Mastiffs as companions.

## Classes and Roles
New recruits to the Boros Legion, are sent to the prestigious [[Horizon Military Academy]] for training. Their life there is tempered in the forge of Boros discipline, devotion, and zeal. Their training regimen is deliberately harsh, to weed out the uncommitted. Those who lasted to the end, begin their career ready to put everything they have learned to use in the legion's service. Depending on whether they focused on martial training, studied magic, or pursued both courses, their path will look somewhat different.
### Martial Training
The bulk of the Boros Legion consists of [[Human]], [[Minotaur]], and [[Goblin]] soldiers. They are a fighters, rangers, or even barbarians.

### Magical Study
Spellcasters like evocation wizards or a clerics of the Light Domain, find a place as a combat mage in the Boros Legion, called an embermage. These mages use spells of fire and light to clear the way for the legion's combat troops.

Those who prefer healing magic over the explosive magic of the embermages like clerics of the Life or the Light Domain, become medics. These combat healers are an essential part of Boros operations, using a combination of magic and mundane medicine to close wounds and restore strength.

### Military Magic
Paladins who swears the Oath of Devotion, fighters of the Eldritch Knight archetype, or clerics of the War Domain, combine the martial training of a soldier with magic and call themselves firefist. Fueled by a healthy dose of righteous zeal, firefists command a great deal of respect in the Boros Legion.

# Enemies and Allies
In general, the Boros find some common ground with other guilds that value order and structure: [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]], [[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]], and (to a lesser extent) [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]. The [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]], [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]], and [[Izzet League|Izzet]] might share the zeal and energy of the Boros, but they represent the more chaotic aspect of those qualities, which threatens the stability of all [[Ravnica]].

The legion is dedicated to combating the influence of [[House Dimir|Dimir]] spies and infiltrators, containing the brutal chaos of the Rakdos, and halting the schemes of the [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]]. But any guild can become an enemy of Boros if its aims and activities lead to crime, chaos, injustice, or harm to the innocent citizens of Ravnica. Even the Azorius can become so obsessive in creating and enforcing laws that they overreach the bounds of justice.

Conversely, any guild can offer you allies in your quest for justice. Distasteful as they might be, even the Gruul and the Rakdos can play a part in curtailing threats to the city that also impede their own interests.
## The Guilds View on Other Guilds
The Boros are committed to justice and order, and they are convinced that virtually every other guild is just as committed to undermining both. Therefore, the Boros rely only on their comrades for support and view everyone else with suspicion or disdain.
- **[[Azorius Senate|Azorius]]**. "Legalism. Arrogance. Hot air. The law in their hands is a bludgeon, and they use it to seize more power than they deserve."

- **[[House Dimir|Dimir]]**. "Snakes lurking in the shadows. They should be rooted out so they can shrivel in the light."

- **[[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]]**. "If they limited themselves to their intended purpose, repulsive as it is, they could be allowed to survive. But they are growing into a dangerous menace, and we need to flush them out of the sewers while we still can."

- **[[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]**. "They are lost in violence and savagery. Only occasionally can their energy be channeled in directions that benefit the greater good."

- **[[Izzet League|Izzet]]**. "They don't understand the concept of limits. If they kept their spellcraft under control, they could truly benefit society."

- **[[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]**. "The Orzhov care only about the Orzhov. If it were up to them, all of Ravnica would follow an orderly process designed to funnel wealth into their grasping hands."

- **[[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]**. "They make destruction into a spectacle, but they're more than blood and fire. They're termites gnawing away at the heart and soul of [[Ravnica]]."

- **[[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]**. "I almost envy the naiveté that leads them to retreat into their little communes and pretend they've built a just society."

- **[[Simic Combine|Simic]]**. "They have stepped out of their place, with all their experiments, their tinkering with the nature of life. They're a waste, a drain on Ravnica, and a danger to the public good."
