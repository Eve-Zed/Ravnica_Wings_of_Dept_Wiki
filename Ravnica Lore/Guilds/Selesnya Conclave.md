The Selesnya Conclave is the white/green guild from [[Ravnica]]. They strife to protect and foster nature with a mighty military presence. Their ideals are Nature and Unity above all else.

Like a thriving garden, carefully tended and abundantly fertile, the communities of the Selesnya Conclave are a harmonious union of nature and civilisation. The members of the conclave dream of embracing all of [[Ravnica]] in their peaceful union. In the meantime, they are growing an army, preparing to resist the ambition and destructive impulses of the other [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]] and fight to defend their way of life.

At the heart of the Selesnya faith and philosophy is the Worldsoul, called [[Mat'Selesnya]], which its devotees believe to be a manifestation of nature itself. At the signing of the original [[Guildpact]], Mat'Selesnya was embodied in an elemental form and acted as the guild's first guildmaster. The current guildmaster, [[Trostani]]—three [[Dryad|dryads]] fused together with Mat'Selesnya into a single being—is said to embody the will of the Worldsoul in a similar way. The original mission of the conclave involved conservation and charity, but its focus has long been on expanding its community, in which all members are cared for and nature is preserved in harmony with civilisation.

## Goals of the Selesnya
Despite the growing tensions that now grip the world, in the long view of the Selesnya Conclave, not much has changed. [[Ravnica]] is troubled, but Ravnica has always been troubled. The [[Jace Beleren|Living Guildpact]] is absent, but the [[Guildpact]] comes and goes. The Worldsoul has not changed, nor has the will of Mat'Selesnya: the conclave's main goal is to grow, as it has always been. Its strength lies in its numbers.

The conclave clings to the ideal of a peaceful collective in which individual desires are subordinate to the good of the whole group. The guild wants to see this beloved community grow, flourish, and thrive in peace. But as much as it values peace within the community, it displays incredible ferocity when that harmony is threatened.

Selesnya's vision is centered on the idea of harmony between civilization and nature. To advance the cause of civilized society, the conclave believes in the need for an ordered structure that orients the group toward the pursuit of the common good. At the same time, the guild's connection with the natural world gives the conclave a fervent appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. Selesnya doesn't tolerate selfishness or ambition, instead urging its members to put the needs of others ahead of their own desires and to use the power of nature—including nature's wrath—to drive away those whose selfishness threatens the coherence of the group.

The greatest danger that Selesnya faces lies in the ambitions of other [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]], which are flourishing in the absence of the [[Guildpact]]. Selesnya's way of curbing this grasping selfishness has always been to outnumber the other guilds. Its members aren't naive; they fully realize that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence. And they aim to be prepared for that violence when it erupts.

"For my seedlings to survive," [[Mat'Selesnya]] says, "we must grow an army capable of overwhelming such ambitions." Some of that army is literally grown, in the case of [[Plant|plant creatures]] and [[Elemental|elementals]]. A great many members grow up in the guild from childhood and learn their martial skills at the guild's training grounds. And still more join the guild through recruitment—especially in these troubling times, when rumors of war and a sense of imminent doom make Selesnya's message of harmonious community sound ever more appealing.
# History
# Selesnya Members
## Species and Creatures
The Selesnya Conclave uses its close connection to nature to enlist a variety of creatures to its cause. These supporters of the conclave take their rightful place in the natural order alongside its more humanlike members.
### Elementals
[[Elemental|Elementals]] rise to the guild's defense when the Selesnya Conclave is drawn into conflict. Most of these elementals are made from the roots and branches of trees, making them equivalent to [[Awakened Shrub|awakened shrubs]] or [[Awakened Tree|awakened trees]]. [[Earth Elemental|Earth elementals]] incorporate building materials in their forms to serve as armor and weapons.
### Plant Creatures
Many Selesnya buildings, temples, and paths are protected by [[Treant|treants]] or carnivorous plants, including [[Blight|blights]] and [[Shambling Mound|shambling mounds]]. Some have vine-like arms that ensnare prey and drop it into pitcher-like bodies filled with acid. Others are covered with sticky glue that immobilizes and slowly digests the hapless victim.
### Pegasi
Most often found carrying equenauts in battle, [[Pegasus|pegasi]] are ready allies who share the guild's goals and virtues. Members of the guild raise them from infancy, carefully protecting the foals from [[Griffin|griffins]], [[Drake|drakes]], and other aerial predators.
## Classes and Roles
New initiates come to the Selesnya Conclave as children, to be brought up by the guild's members, or as recruits drawn from the [[The Guildless|guildless]] or the membership of other [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]]. Regardless of the path they took to get here, they start out in the role of initiate. As an initiate, they must subsume their desires to the needs of the guild while finding a way (under the guidance of their enclave's leader) to put their talents to use in service to [[Mat'Selesnya]]. This effort isn't so much a process of carrying out orders, but of gradually discerning the will of the Worldsoul and finding their place in it.

In their search for communion with the Worldsoul, they are part of a worldwide community, but they are also part of a smaller local community—an enclave called a [[vernadi]], which is led by a [[Dryad]] called a [[voda]]. Their role in the conclave is specifically oriented toward their vernadi, at least at the start of their career. Their voda helps them in their process of discerning the will of Mat'Selesnya and their place in relation to it.

The Selesnya Conclave is both a community of worshipers and a militia, and thus its leadership includes both military and religious figures.
### Military Roles
Selesnya looks from the outside like a peaceful community, but it is also an army. If you are a fighter, a ranger, or a paladin, your place in the guild is a military one. Unlike in the [[Boros Legion]], though, the conclave's military ranks aren't highly structured; each enclave has its own forces, with a single commander and one other layer of command (at most) above the troops. A variety of special military roles become available to you as you prove yourself useful to your vernadi and the conclave. You might aspire to be a votary standing watch over the temple gardens, a sagittar archer, a [[Pegasus|pegasus]]-riding equenaut, or a [[Wolf|wolf]]-riding Ledev guardian.

### Religious Roles
Druids, clerics, warlocks with [[Mat'Selesnya]] as a patron, or devout monks, might be drawn to a role of religious leadership. These leaders mediate the relationship between the members of the conclave and the voice of Mat'Selesnya. A number of special roles will be available to them as they establish their place. They hope to carry the message of the conclave out into the world as an evangel, and great religious leaders are honoured with the title of hierarch.
# Enemies and Allies
The Selesnya philosophy is one that embraces all of [[Ravnica]]. Everyone is a potential ally, until the moment they demonstrate their hostility to the conclave or the will of the [[Mat'Selesnya|Worldsoul]]. The Selesnya have difficulty with the riotous [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]], the sinister [[House Dimir|Dimir]], and the chaotic [[Izzet League|Izzet]], but their focus on ordered community and verdant nature gives them some amount of common ground with every other guild.

Any guild can become an enemy of the conclave, though, if its guildmaster's ambitions—or rogue agents within the guild—upset the balance of power on Ravnica. From the other side, many other guilds see the Selesnya as a quiet threat and seek to diminish its strength before its numbers grow out of control, so as a member of the conclave you are duty-bound to oppose their operations of sabotage. The wanton plunder of Ravnica's natural resources can also provoke the Selesnya to take action.

When members of other [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]] pursue noble aims—promoting peace, strengthening community, and opposing other guilds' efforts to expand—they act as allies of the conclave and thus your allies. Furthermore, they are potential recruits into the fold, since they have demonstrated their sympathy for Selesnya's goals and their value to the community.
## The Selesnya View on Other Guilds
In the Selesnya vision of a perfect Ravnica, the guilds would be abolished and all people would live in harmony with nature and each other. Until such a vision comes to pass, the conclave judges the other guilds against that standard of perfection.

**[[Azorius Senate|Azorius]]**. "All their laws are meant to create a semblance of the unity that binds us already. If they would only be still and listen to the voice of [[Mat'Selesnya]]."

**[[Boros Legion|Boros]]**. "Sooner or later they will tire of their fighting, and when they do, the gentle embrace of the Selesnya will be waiting for them."

**[[House Dimir|Dimir]]**. "Just as they hide from the light and cling to the shadows, they hide from life and cling to secrets. They see everything as a scheme, everyone a tool, instead of recognising the power of unity and mutual growth."

**[[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]]**. "They wallow in filth and rot, too preoccupied with death to appreciate the bliss of life's connections."

**[[Gruul]]**. "They are a desperate echo of what they should be, reaching blindly toward something greater. Such a waste. And a smelly, unreasonable, destructive one at that."

**[[Izzet League|Izzet]]**. "The path to unity doesn't lie in the oppressive control of a massive ego like the [[Dragon|dragon]]'s. The Izzet can tinker and meddle all they like, but they are doomed to failure."

**[[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]**. "An endless stream of grasping hands, reaching for more and more, pursuing their individual ambitions at all costs—even from beyond the grave."

**[[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]**. "They laugh at tragedy and wallow in pain. Eventually, they will submit to Mat'Selesnya. Until then, they must be contained."

**[[Simic Combine|Simic]]**. "They chart a twisted course of warping and mangling life and nature. Yes, we must grow and adapt, but nature will take its own time in completing that task."
