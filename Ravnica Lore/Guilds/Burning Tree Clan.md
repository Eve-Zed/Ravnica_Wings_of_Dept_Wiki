The Burning Tree clan is the most fearsome of the [[Gruul Clans]], as well as the largest and most diverse, with branches in several districts of [[Ravnica]]. The fear and awe inspired by [[Borborygmos]] unifies its diverse membership. The Ravnican populace regards the symbol of the Burning Tree clan as the symbol for the entire Gruul guild.
