The Gruul Clans are the green/red guild from [[Ravnica]]. They lost their original purpose and are now wild anarchists. Their ideals are Strength and Nature above all else.
![[Pasted image 20251104202923.png]]
The Gruul Clans are a wild people in a civilized land, a loose affiliation of bands that squat on the fringes of Ravnican society. They shun the centers of civilization, which they see as a source of oppression and weakness, and instead haunt [[Ravnica]]'s alleyways, abandoned zones, and ruins. They want to see the edifice of civilization torn down so the world can revert to the pure wilderness that thrived before the city grew to cover everything. Then the true order of nature can be restored—an unbridled and brutal state in which only the strong survive and the strongest rule.

In a world covered with city streets and towering buildings, the Gruul are the most out of place, the most ill at ease, and the most eager to topple it all and start fresh. Constant ritualistic warfare reverberates among the clans, every skirmish reinforcing their doctrine of the survival of the fittest. They frequently send sorties into civilized areas to secure goods—and to wreak havoc.

The first leader of the Gruul was [[Cisarzim]], a [[cyclops]] who was purportedly the ancestor of [[Borborygmos]], the current guildmaster. Cisarzim was called the Lord of Chaos, and his guild's original function as maintainers of Ravnica's natural places meant keeping his faction as remote as possible from the civilized parts of the world. The gradual expansion of the city, however, has driven the Gruul into smaller and smaller refuges.

# Inside the Guild
As a collection of disparate clans, the Gruul have no single leader and no headquarters. But the Gruul respect strength and are willing to follow a strong individual who points them in a direction they want to go anyway. For several decades, that position has been held by the mighty [[cyclops]] [[Borborygmos]], chief of the [[Burning Tree clan]]. His nihilistic anger inspires the rest of the Gruul, so when he calls on the other clans to join a raid, they usually agree. Even the fractious Gruul can see the benefit of banding together. The clans sometimes gather at [[Skarrg]], a ruined palace in the rubblebelt adjoining the [[Tenth District]].

## Goals of the Gruul
So far as any philosophy can be said to underlie the Gruul way of life, it is about living in the now, with little concern for forethought, planning, or speculation. Impulse drives the actions of the Gruul Clans. They want to live their lives unimpeded, and they lash out when something tries to stand in their way. Emotion and impulsiveness drive them as they seek to do what they want, take what they want, and smash what they want.
# History
# Guild Members
## Species and Creatures
Many dangerous creatures haunt [[the rubblebelts]] and other places the Gruul Clans inhabit.
### Beasts
Gruul territory is full of [[Beast|beasts]] of all sizes. Herds of [[giant boars]] called batterboars roam the rubblebelts; each batterboar can grow to be the size of a mammoth, and the passage of a herd can shake the ground and topple buildings. [[Maaka]] are territorial cats, about 15 feet long, with six eyes. They typically keep to the rubblebelts, though from time to time they are spotted amid tended groves and gardens.

Any beast can roam the rubblebelts. The Gruul can bring out the fury in these beasts, turning them into [[ragebeasts]]. 
### Elementals
Gruul shamans channel primal energies to summon raging [[fire elementals]] that blaze ahead of marauding Gruul bands. Or they transform the rubble and detritus of civilization into [[Earth Elemental|earth elementals]], twisted through with choking vines, that literally give new life to the ruin of the city. These [[Elemental|elementals]] are intensely destructive, but they last only as long as the magic used to summon them persists.
### Giants
Nearly all the Gruul Clans include [[hill giants]], [[stone giants]], [[cyclopes]], [[ogres]], [[ettins]], and [[fomorians]] among their number, and one clan—the [[Bolrac clan]]—is composed entirely of such brutes.
### Hydras
Once a [[hydra]] chooses a lair and declares the surrounding land its territory, it's almost impossible to drive the creature out. The Gruul revere these multiheaded predators as vestiges of the ancient times before the guilds took over the world. They don't kill hydras for trophies, but pulling a spine from a hydra's neck is a mark of great bravery among the Gruul.
## Classes and Roles
One might have been born and raised among the Gruul, like many of the guild's members. Or they could be an outcast, a refugee, or a fugitive from civilized society, shunned for their violent ways or for fleeing the hand of justice. As long as they're strong enough to survive among the Gruul, they're welcome, no matter what secrets haunt their past.

The Gruul "guild" is actually a collection of different, independent clans loosely united under one powerful leader. When one decides to join the Gruul, they join a specific clan, not the guild as a whole.

The rites of becoming Gruul, whether one has come from outside the guild or are marking their entrance into adulthood, center around being buried alive. When they enter the shallow grave, the person they were before is dead. Their past wrongs and errors are forgotten, but so are their past accomplishments. No matter how well they proved themselves in battle before, when they rise from the earth they are untested. The clan leaders recognize them only when they earn glory in battle as a Gruul.

Most of the Gruul find their place among the fierce warriors of their clans such as fighters, rangers, or barbarians. Whatever their class, as a Gruul warrior they are devoted to tearing down the edifices of civilization, both physical and institutional. They lash out at a system that they believe is the root of corruption and weakness.

If they are spellcaster, such as a druid or a cleric of the Tempest Domain, they might adopt a more spiritual role in their clan. They practice what the Gruul call the Old Ways, a discipline that predates the foundation of civilization on [[Ravnica]], to channel the primal energy that still pulses through the wild places of the world
# Enemies and Allies
By standing in opposition to the civilized ways of the other guilds, the Gruul Clans have made it practically impossible to establish alliances with those guilds.

Similar to the Golgari, Selesnya, and Simic, the Gruul respect nature and maintain a close relationship with animals—in the Gruul's case, the monstrous beasts that stalk the rubble and ruins. But the Gruul would just as soon smash the sewers, gardens, and laboratories of those other guilds than cooperate with them in an effort to establish nature as a larger presence within the city.

Because they see all of the remaining guilds as cogs in the vast machine of civilization, the Gruul tailor their tactics toward breaking the machine, rather than directing their attacks at any particular guild. Any guild can be the target of Gruul aggression, as the opportunity arises. The fiercest assaults often come against the guilds that take it upon themselves to combat the Gruul, primarily the Boros and Azorius.

In certain circumstances, such as when some nightmarish horror rears its head in the heart of a rubblebelt, you and your clan could accept the help of members of another guild in putting an end to the danger. Or, when the schemes of other guilds pit one clan against another, there might be some benefit to you and your clan in cooperating with those efforts. But your truest allies are other members of your clan.
## The Guilds View on Other Guilds
- **[[Azorius Senate|Azorius]]**. "Civilization is a disease, and the Azorius are its plague bearers. Once they are destroyed, [[Ravnica]] will reclaim its primal essence."
- **[[Boros Legion|Boros]]**. "Puppets who are all too eager to kneel at the feet of their [[Angel]] handlers."
- **[[House Dimir|Dimir]]**. "Skulkers, whisperers, and back-stabbers! They are an infestation of roaches. If they remain in the shadows, they will be crushed beneath the rubble of a city that we bring down on their heads. If they face us in open battle, well, then we'll have a good laugh."
- **[[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]]**. "Hermits and under-dwellers. They see that civilization must be brought to its knees, but they just want to replace it with another of their design."
- **[[Izzet League|Izzet]]**. "Like us, they respect the powerful. But they seek it in their gadgets and try to contain it in jars."
- **[[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]**. "The schemers of the Orzhov are the festering wound on a limb that must be hacked away. They amass their power by preying on the weak, so how powerful can they be?"
- **[[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]**. "The guild of fools. They waste their potential on acts of mockery while the real work of razing the city remains undone."
- **[[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]**. "The Selesnya would coddle a [[Wolf]], teach it to fetch sticks, and call it a dog. We prefer to starve the wolf, let it hunt for its food, and make it a stronger wolf."
- **[[Simic Combine|Simic]]**. "The Simic enjoy twisting nature, but they will not enjoy it when nature twists back."
