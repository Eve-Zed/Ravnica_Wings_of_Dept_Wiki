The [[Selesnya Conclave]] is organised into enclaves called vernadi, which are communes built around central trees. The vernadi are smaller versions of the guildhall, the great city-tree [[Vitu-Ghazi]]. Each vernadi is led by a [[Voda]], connecting the vernadi and its devotees to the [[Mat'Selesnya|Worldsoul]] and uniting them with the will of the entire conclave.
In addition to the voda, military and religious leaders in each vernadi regularly communicate with its members. Ordinary members of the conclave spend a few hours every day training with a military instructor and studying with a religious teacher.
