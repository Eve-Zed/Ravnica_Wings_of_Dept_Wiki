Some wandering hermits, known as trogs, find even the company of a clan to be too suffocating, so they spend their days alone in the wild places of [[Ravnica]]. These individuals are fierce, independent warriors who traverse [[the rubblebelts]] as apex predators. Trogs are notoriously short-tempered and impatient around others. Occasionally, they heed the call of the [[Borborygmos|guildmaster]] to join in riots or festivals, but more often they conduct their own ceremonies and celebrations in private.
