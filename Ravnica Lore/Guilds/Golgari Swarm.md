The Golgari Swarm is the green/black guild from [[Ravnica]]. Their duties are farming and garbage disposal. Their ideal is primarily are Life from Death.

The teeming masses that compose the Golgari Swarm see themselves as pragmatic above all else, uncowed by the simple fact that death is part of the cycle of life. They believe the idea of life and death as opposing forces to be nothing more than naive sentimentality. They know everything crumbles and rots in the end, and then new life springs from that rot. Time inevitably passes, bringing both destruction and new creation to all things.

The original mandate of the Golgari Swarm under the leadership of [[Svogthir]], its [[Devkarin]] founder, was to maintain [[Ravnica]]'s agriculture and manage its waste. But Svogthir's interest in necromancy, and his eventual transformation into a [[lich]], shaped the course of the guild's activities and gave birth to its philosophy of embracing death as part of nature's cycle.

# Inside the Guild
The leadership of the Golgari has undergone several major changes, but the nature of the swarm makes it easily adaptable to the churn of continuous cycles. Being alive isn't a prerequisite for leadership, as demonstrated by the rule of the current guildmaster, the [[Elf]] [[lich]] [[Jarad Vod Savo]]. Assassination is seen as a perfectly valid means of effecting political change, which is how Jarad's sister, [[Savra vod Savo|Savra]], took control of the guild before him. Various groups of people and monsters coexist within the swarm, their relative power waxing and waning with the years, and through it all, the guild goes on.

The three most important power groups within the Golgari are the [[Devkarin]] elves, the [[Gorgon|medusas]] (also called gorgons in Ravnica), and the insectile [[kraul]]. Jarad is an [[Undead]] representative of the Devkarin, so the elves claim a privileged position within the guild for the moment.

Members of the Golgari Swarm live in the shadow of Jarad and the leaders of the individual factions. The machinations among elves, medusas, kraul, and other creatures rarely bring any significant improvement to the lives of the swarm's countless members, but often cause disruption and occasionally disaster. Most guild members believe it's best to keep their heads down and stay out of the political conflict and to avoid attracting the disfavor of the [[Ochran]], the guild's order of assassins. More adventurous members might enjoy intrigue and politics, or might unwittingly become tangled up in the schemes of the guild's leaders.

Jarad maintains a council of shamans and rogues to serve as a combination of advisory parliament and spy agency. These high chancellors rarely convene publicly, preferring to disperse themselves throughout the swarm to keep information flowing from the nucleus to every part of the organism.
## Goals of the Golgari
The Golgari Swarm celebrates the growth and vibrancy of the natural world, but gives equal attention to nature's facets of destruction, decay, and death. It finds allies and agents in the form of fungi, oozes, insects, diseases, and other unsavory aspects of nature, and it uses the power of nature actively toward the goal of advancing its own place in the world. But the Golgari have also learned patience from nature; they are content to work from the shadows, harnessing the energy that comes from decay while the civilization of [[Ravnica]] slowly erodes and destroys itself.

The teeming hordes of the Golgari Swarm believe it is finally their time to shine. They have dwelled under the streets and under the sway of the other guilds for too long. They are convinced that Ravnica's institutions are now on the verge of collapse and that the absence of the [[Jace Beleren|Living Guildpact]] proves it. However, the Golgari are neither surprised nor panicked by this, for they believe that all things eventually rot and die, and from this decay, new life blooms. As such, the Golgari see the looming interguild conflict as a necessary final push to bring about a new era—their era.

The Golgari are preparing for upheaval. They have sealed many of the passages leading into the [[undercity]], making their territory seem like an impregnable subterranean fortress. Within it, the Golgari domain retains its grandeur, a mysterious and wondrous kingdom. The rare visitors who stumble into it are awed by its beauty and its aura of ancient power. Palatial architecture fills cavernous sewer chambers, and luminescent spores float through the air to shed an otherworldly light on the moss-covered masonry. Entering Golgari territory feels like stepping into a secret world of dangerous beauty.
# History
# Guild Members
## Species and Creatures
The [[Devkarin]] elves, deadly [[Gorgon|gorgons]], and insectile [[kraul]] are the three most important power groups among the Golgari Swarm, vying for control over a teeming horde of lesser (or at least less ambitious) creatures.
### Erstwhile
A significant shift in the Golgari balance of power began when the [[kraul]] death priest [[Mazirek]] discovered an ancient mausoleum compound. Deep in the [[undercity]], beneath the layers of civilization that had built up over millennia, Mazirek found a hidden network of vaults called [[Umerilek]], an enormous structure that would have dominated a city block. Inside were hundreds of well-preserved corpses suffused with a latent necromantic power that Mazirek activated, bringing the corpses back to a shambling semblance of life. This new race of [[Undead]] is called the [[Erstwhile]].

In their time, the Erstwhile were aristocratic [[Elf|elves]] of immense wealth and opulence. They still wear their stately attire, despite its moldering condition, and they lend an air of high culture to the undercity court of the Golgari.
### Fungus
Golgari territory is filled with creatures composed of [[fungus]] and detritus from the guild's rot farms. [[Shriekers]] serve as sentries in Golgari tunnels, and [[violet fungus]] sprouts from the corpses of intruders. Amorphous masses of dead and decaying matter can develop into [[Shambling Mound|shambling mounds]] in the spore-saturated environment of the undercity.

Some Golgari creatures are symbiotic fusions of fungus and living creatures. Golgari [[trolls]] are hulking sewer dwellers with fungus adorning their bodies like manes, acting as extra layers for their already tough hide and facilitating their regeneration.
### Insects and Arachnids
Beetles, centipedes, spiders, and countless other insects and arachnids infest Golgari warrens. These creatures, often associated with decay and rebirth, are prized by the guild. Giant bugs serve as beasts of burden, companions, steeds, and guardians. Among the largest of these is the [[Deadbridge goliath beetle]].

[[Piranha beetles]] burrow through the soft earth and gather into swarms to overtake their victims and strip the flesh from them. [[Skein spiders]] are an important part of Golgari reclamation work: fungus grows rapidly along the silken spiderwebs, expanding to engulf architecture and hasten the Golgari annexation process.
### Zombies
The guild encourages the use and exploration of necromancy. Fungus covers the bodies of most of the [[Undead]] that serve the guild, the majority of which are [[fungus drudges]]—mindless servants animated by the fungus that infests their bodies.
## Classes and Roles
Similar to a swarm of insects, the Golgari collectively behave more like a single organism than a scattering of individuals. New members aren't recruited or initiated into the Golgari Swarm; they are absorbed and incorporated, and the biological system of the swarm funneled them to where their talents are most needed to contribute to the health of the guild.

They might act as a shaman of the Golgari if they are a spellcaster—perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Necromancy, a druid of the Circle of the Land, or a druid of the Circle of Spores. In this revered position, they teach and advise other members of the swarm, keeping them attuned to the natural cycle of death and regrowth. They might manipulate that natural cycle by wielding the magic of death, snuffing out life and reanimating the dead. Or they might their your magic to spread fungal rot and noxious gases, preparing parts of the city for annexation.

If they aren't adept at magic, the swarm still needs them. Golgari warriors both defend the guild's territory and, when necessary, take offensive action. If they are a fighter, typically of the Champion archetype, they can serve as a shock trooper, perhaps fighting alongside [[kraul]] and [[trolls]] on behalf of the swarm. If they are a ranger likely of the Beast Master archetype or a rogue of the Thief or Assassin archetype, they are more of a skirmisher. Golgari rangers favor insects and reptiles as companions.
# Enemies and Allies
The Golgari Swarm shares a general philosophical approach with the other nature-oriented guilds—[[Simic Combine|Simic]], [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]], and [[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]—in its concern for the forces of life and growth. Under the right circumstances, a member of the Golgari can work well with agents of those organizations. But the Golgari's emphasis on death as part of the life cycle is foreign to those other guilds.

The Golgari prefer to erode their enemies' strength through a process of attrition rather than by launching frontal attacks. If you are called on to take direct action against another guild, it is probably a matter of self-preservation against a guild that is threatening the life and livelihood of the Golgari. You might oppose the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]] as they attempt to extend their jurisdiction into the undercity or strike back at the [[Boros Legion|Boros]] to dissuade them from launching more attacks into Golgari territory. Occasionally, you might be assigned to assault the enemies of the Golgari more directly, especially if you are a member of the [[Ochran]]. If the death of a particular person or the theft of a key treasure will contribute to the decline and downfall of an enemy guild, even the typically patient Golgari will try to seize that opportunity.

You might ally with members of another guild if they are working—even unwittingly—toward goals you share. The Gruul, for example, are adept at hastening the decay of both humanoid populations and physical structures, even if they remain unaware of their full role in the natural cycle. If some event threatens to upset the balance of nature, such as a necromantic blight that kills all growth or a magical wildfire rampaging through the city, you might join other nature-oriented guilds in an attempt to curtail it and preserve the balance.
## The Guilds View on Other Guilds
- **[[Azorius Senate|Azorius]]**. "Such hubris! As if all their laws could shore up this crumbling society. Their regulations and institutions are just detritus in the making."

- **[[Boros Legion|Boros]]**. "The Boros speak a language we will never understand. Their militant dedication to empty concepts like 'justice' and 'righteousness' is both confusing and disturbing."

- **[[House Dimir|Dimir]]**. "They collect information like trinkets, so how can they ever grasp the deeper truths we possess? But their presence in the [[undercity]] is an all-too-real threat to our dominion beneath the streets."

- **[[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]**. "The clans serve as effective instruments of the natural cycle, though in their anger, they are blind to the extent of the role they play."

- **[[Izzet League|Izzet]]**. "Perplexing. They are attracted to whatever flashes brightest and booms loudest. Their fascination with their toys will only hasten their own end."

- **[[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]**. "They flout the natural order and use their knowledge of death to resist its pull. While their bodies rot, their spirits persist, clinging to the fiction of material wealth."

- **[[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]**. "They understand the inevitability of death but seek to hasten its arrival for their petty ends. What the demon destroys, we nurse back to life again."

- **[[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]**. "Their reverence for nature is the mark of immaturity and naiveté. They fear death, so they can't understand life. They can be dangerous when they fervently cling to their narrow-minded and inadequate view of life."

- **[[Simic Combine|Simic]]**. "They seek patterns in the natural world, which is commendable enough, but they believe the search will lead them to find perfection through all of its flaws. They strive to move forward but fail to see that the path they tread is cyclical."
