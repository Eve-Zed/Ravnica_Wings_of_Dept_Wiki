> A vampire appeared out of the darkness, as quiet as a breeze. He was stripped to the waist despite the chill underground, and his eyes reflected light like a cat's. He floated effortlessly down from the upper reaches of the chamber, and alighted on the chamber floor near the two of them.

House Dimir is [[Ravnica]]'s dark secret: behind a facade of respectable messengers and reporters lurks an association of spies and assassins whose existence is barely suspected by the populace at large. Secrecy is both House Dimir's best weapon and its best defence, and much of the guild's work is hidden even from other members. Dimir agents leave no trace of their covert activities, warping the memories of witnesses to their crimes and even wiping their own minds to remove any evidence of their completed assignments.

The first guildmaster of House Dimir was a [[Vampire|vampire]] named [[Szadek]], whose organisation agreed to serve as Ravnica's couriers, information brokers, and librarians. But Szadek also used his guild's expertise at gathering information to build a vast spy network, and before long, the secret operations of the guild vastly outweighed its overt ones. Eventually the guild disappeared into the shadows, and most Ravnicans came to doubt its existence. An immortal entity, Szadek ruled the guild for ten thousand years until he was arrested and killed in the turmoil of the [[Guildpact#Decamillennial Celebration|Decamillennial Celebration]].

# Inside the House
House Dimir has a clandestine aspect hidden from all but its most important members. The guildmaster, [[Lazav]], and his direct contacts guide and manipulate the covert operations of the guild. Members of House Dimir ultimately receive their orders from this source without having any idea of who issued the order or why. Messages to agents are funnelled through thought strands and telepathic couriers.

By design, you don't have much interaction with other members of your guild. You might never meet your primary guild contact face to face, instead receiving assignments and sending reports by way of secret message drops and codes.
## Goals of the Dimir
House Dimir is all about secrets and misinformation, even where its own members are concerned. Any given Dimir agent knows of no more than a handful of alleyway contacts and dossier drop spots. One agent knows another only by a code name, or receives communications only at a particular meeting spot at a specific place and time. Every self-proclaimed expert with an opinion on the matter has a theory about the guild's intentions, and all those guesses about Dimir's motivations and pursuits contradict each other, frustrating any attempt to get to the truth of things. The public face of Dimir remains inscrutable, which some interpret as the best evidence that the guild's true plans mean something dire for the Ravnican populace.

To House Dimir, knowledge is power. The guild hungers to learn everything it doesn't already know, especially the weaknesses of its adversaries, and to exploit those weaknesses for its own gain. Conversely, the house holds its own secrets tightly, because it doesn't want its enemies to turn the tables. The Dimir lurk in the shadows, methodically gathering the knowledge they need to remake [[Ravnica]] to their advantage.

House Dimir's progress toward its goals depends on a web woven from meticulously gathered intelligence. Unpredictable behavior by other guilds can destabilize that web. When the [[Boros Legion|Boros]] take sudden, forceful action inspired by an unexpected burst of zeal, the Dimir can be caught off guard. The [[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]] behave predictably on the whole, but the members of the conclave are so numerous that it can be hard for the Dimir to keep track of their activities. Of all the other guilds, the [[Izzet League|Izzet]] and the [[Gruul Clans|Gruul]] concern the Dimir the most; their erratic methods of decision-making, combined with their unflinching approach to danger, can quickly undermine any Dimir strategy designed to contain them.
# Dimir Members
Alongside [[Human|human]] and [[Vampire|vampire]] spies and assassins, a variety of stealthy and shadowy monsters contribute to the work of House Dimir. [[Shapeshifter|Doppelgangers]] and invisible stalkers move unseen among the populace. [[Horror|Horrors]]—as well as [[Grick|gricks]], [[Intellect Devourer|intellect devourers]], and similar monsters—are thought to be the fears of Ravnica's populace given form by Dimir magic. And [[Undead|undead]] such as [[Shadow|shadows]], [[Wraith|wraiths]], and [[Specter#Nightveil Specter|Nightveil specters]] keep watch over secret Dimir territories.
## Joining House Dimir
You began your career in House Dimir as part of the legion of shopkeepers, librarians, couriers, and traders who maintain the deception that the guild has become civil and tame. Without any exposure to the guild's more covert activities, you helped to discredit those who believe that the Dimir are plotting to control the city, painting them as delusional conspiracy theorists. But at some point your gifts were recognized and you were invited into the deeper mysteries of the guild. Your training focused on stealth, espionage, and infiltration. As a Dimir spy, you might bring a variety of talents to your work.

In your guild role, you engage in surveillance, theft, sabotage, infiltration, and other kinds of espionage. You work in a pocket or sleeper cell, unaware of the identities of most other agents or the guild's leadership.

If you are a spellcaster, you have the skills needed to join the ranks of the most feared spellcasters on [[Ravnica]]: House Dimir's mind mages. Your basic work and role is the same as any other spy's, but you can learn to pull thoughts and memories from a person's mind, use a target's own thoughts against them, attack your foes' psyches directly to create delusions, or scour enemy minds clean.
## Mind Mage
Dimir mind mages are among the most feared spellcasters in Ravnica, thanks in large part to the aura of mystery that shrouds them and their work. Their ability to read and alter memories commands respect from the other members of House Dimir and makes them useful in the full spectrum of the guild's activities. Many mind mages lead cells of their own.
## Thought Spy
Thought spies form the backbone of House Dimir's covert operations. They are trained in stealth and infiltration, tactics that they supplement with rigorously developed mental abilities. To ensure that no secrets slip through Dimir's fingers, they infiltrate rival guilds. In addition to traditional means of gathering intelligence, thought spies use their magic to spy on the thoughts of their targets.
# Enemies and Allies
It's hard for a guild built on stealth and secrecy to maintain a positive relationship with any other guild. All [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]] are monitored with suspicion, and they assessed for their current and prospective levels of threat, as well as for their usefulness to House Dimir's schemes. Each cell may foster its own relationships with the other guilds, but it ultimately defers to Dimir's enigmatic leaders to steer overarching strategy.

Your missions might put you at odds with any other guild by calling on you to infiltrate that guild and gain insight into its plans, steal proprietary information from its guildhall, or subvert its leadership. For instance, you could be tasked to steal the transcript of an Azorius interrogation, the memories of [[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]] spy, or the contents of an [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]] ledger.

You might cooperate with members of other guilds, openly or in disguise, insofar as their goals don't conflict with yours. Sometimes, the easiest way to assassinate one of your enemies is to put the forces of law on their trail, so joining forces with the [[Azorius Senate|Azorius]] and [[Boros Legion|Boros]], for example, can be a beneficial arrangement for everyone concerned.
## The Dimir View on Other Guilds

To House Dimir, every other guild is a potential source of information, its members all potential foils and patsies.

- **[[Azorius Senate|Azorius]]**. "They can't be allowed to monopolize the flow of knowledge. Clog their networks with misinformation. To stop someone from discerning the truth, drown them in plausible untruths."
    
- **[[Boros Legion|Boros]]**. "Not inherently dangerous. The true danger is that they'll drag down all we've worked for while chasing some romantic crusade. Continue to direct their righteous fury toward our strongest enemy—until the Boros threaten to become the strongest."
    
- **[[Golgari Swarm|Golgari]]**. "We once appreciated them for their ability to make a corpse disappear, but we found that too many of our victims rose up to face us again. Now we use the city's fear of the swarm to keep them in their place. The more the Golgari try to rise from the mire of their reputation, the more we make them wallow in it."
    
- **[[Gruul Clans|Gruul]]**. "They've always been convenient scapegoats, but their recent aggressiveness threatens to become a larger problem. We must thin their numbers—selectively and without confrontation. Catch them alone in the dark, and take them out one by one."
    
- **[[Izzet League|Izzet]]**. "Even an overloaded, sizzled clock is still right twice a day. When Izzet experiments succeed, they can have unpredictable consequences for active missions. Their activities must be monitored at all times."
    
- **[[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]]**. "We're amused at how well they've used their hierarchy to mask the corruption of their organisation, but their need for the public's trust gives us an edge. They can be manipulated by playing on their fear of the people discovering their ruse."
    
- **[[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos]]**. "They've turned pointless activity into an art form, but their performances nevertheless make very useful distractions. Let them be bright and loud, drawing all attention, while we slip quietly through the dark."
    
- **[[Selesnya Conclave|Selesnya]]**. "Strength without guile is perhaps the most dangerous kind. One can't bluff the player who can't conceive of bluffing. Currently, the covert war plays to our strengths; we must ensure that the conclave never becomes conscious of the advantages they possess."
    
- **[[Simic Combine|Simic]]**. "They are never short of intriguing surprises, so we know they are gearing up for something. Keep eyes inside their organisation to see what their efforts are leading to—but don't be tempted to partake of their enhancements."
