Martial characters, serve as arresters in the [[Azorius Senate]]. Arresters maintain the peace by removing threats—both actual and potential—identified through regular patrols, citizen reports, and occasionally alerts from the [[precognitive mage]]. As you gain the respect of your superiors, you can be promoted to the rank of officer or imperator.
