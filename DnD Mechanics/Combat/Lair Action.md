Lair actions as defined are always magical in nature. They are essentially the lair acting of its own accord always at the top of the initiative (count of 20).

Each action typically cannot be used until all actions are used, and any lasting effects usually reset at the top of the count.

**Difficult Terrain**. Make an area within the lair [[difficult terrain]] until the top of the next round.

**Obscure Sight**. Make an area within the lair obscured until the top of the next round.

**Snaring**. Objects appear that ensnare creatures within the lair (or on hostile action). Dexterity save to avoid, Strength ([[Athletics]]) / Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) to break free.

**Knockdown**. The lair shakes or does something that knocks characters [[prone]] if they fail a Dexterity save.

**Light Changing**. Magical [[darkness]] or light that can block normal and [[darkvision]], etc.

**Heal Dampening**. Stop a target, or targets from healing for the round.

**Spell Dampening**. Make spell effects act as if targets have [[Advantage]] on saves, or resistance to the damage type.

**Effect on Enter/Exit**. Perform a single action, ability, or spell effect on entrance or exit of the lair.

**Free Action, Ability, or Spell Effect**. A single attack, action, ability, or spell effect on a target creature. This could be a charm, sleep, damage, environmental effect (fire, acid, cold, etc).
