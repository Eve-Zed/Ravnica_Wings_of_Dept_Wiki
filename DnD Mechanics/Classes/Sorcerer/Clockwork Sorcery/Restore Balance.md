Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 18m of yourself is about to roll a d20 with [[Advantage]] or [[Disadvantage]], you can take a [[Reaction]] to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest]].
