_Evocation Cantrip_

**Casting Time**: Action
**Range**: Touch
**Components**: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)
**Duration**: 1 hour

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds [[Bright Light]] in a 6m radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 6m. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.
