Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are [[Aberrations]], [[Celestial|Celestials]], [[Elemental|Elementals]], [[Fey]], [[Fiends]], or [[Undead]]. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have [[Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or gain the [[Charmed]] or [[Frightened]] conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, [[Charmed]], or [[Frightened]] by such a creature, the target has [[Advantage]] on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
