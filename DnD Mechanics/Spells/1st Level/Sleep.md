Each creature of your choice in a 1,5m-radius [[Sphere]] centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the [[Unconscious]] condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 1,5m of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have [[Immunity]] to the [[Exhaustion]] condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.
