If a space is Difficult Terrain, every meter of movement in that space costs 1 extra meter. For example, moving 1,5m through Difficult Terrain costs 3m of movement. Difficult Terrain isn't cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn't.

A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains any of the following or something similar:
- A creature that isn't Tiny or your ally
- Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or larger
- Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth
- Liquid that's between shin- and waist-deep
- A narrow opening sized for a creature one size smaller than you
- A slope of 20 degrees or more
