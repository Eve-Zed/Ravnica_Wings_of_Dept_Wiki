**Restricted Movement**. Your only movement options are to [[Crawling|crawl]] or to spend an amount of movement equal to half your [[Speed]] (round down) to right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your [[Speed]] is 0, you can't right yourself.

**Attacks Affected**. You have [[Disadvantage]] on attack rolls. An attack roll against you has [[Advantage]] if the attacker is within 1,5m of you. Otherwise, that attack roll has [[Disadvantage]].
