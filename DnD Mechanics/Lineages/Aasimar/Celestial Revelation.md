When you reach character level 3, you can transform as a [[Bonus Action]] using one of the options below (choose the option each time you transform). The transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it (no action required). Once you transform, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest]].

Once on each of your turns before the transformation ends, you can deal extra damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your [[Proficiency Bonus]], and the extra damage's type is either Necrotic for Necrotic Shroud or Radiant for Heavenly Wings and Inner Radiance.

Here are the transformation options:
![[Heavenly Wings]]
![[Inner Radiance]]
![[Necrotic Shroud]]
