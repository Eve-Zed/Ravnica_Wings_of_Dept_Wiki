Trostani is the guildmaster of the [[Selesnya Conclave]] on [[Ravnica]], and speaker for [[Mat'Selesnya]].

Trostani is a fusion of three [[Dryad|dryads]]. She appears as three women, seemingly human from the waist up, sinuously bending branches from the waist down. Each of the three heads represent a Selesnyan value: Order, Life, and Harmony. Though Trostani is composed of three individuals, she is not three separate beings, but three aspects of the same being, a single entity that moves according to the world spirit's desires. She is unable to separate from [[Vitu-Ghazi ]]while the tree is healing, but the central dryad can assume control of the tree.
###### The three sisters
Before becoming Trostani, the three [[Dryad|dryads]] had separate names and personalities.

**Oba**, the dryad of Life, was wild and full of life. Her hair was tangled with leaves and vines. Her eyes shift with her moods, from green-like flecks of emerald and jade to smoky brown.
**Ses**, the dryad of Order, was ordered in manner and speech. Her hair was held in place by a headpiece made of goldenwood and fell to her shoulders in a cascade of auburn.
**Cim**, the dryad of Harmony, was the eldest and the bridge between the other two sisters. Despite being a small, slight dryad, everyone within the Selesnya Conclave could feel the power within her. She would always find a way to balance the needs of one with the other.
###### Creation of Trostani
The Selesnya Conclave was in disarray because they gradually lost their connection to [[Mat'Selesnya]], the World Tree. The three Dryad sisters went into a deep trance to try and connect with Mat'Selesnya. During their trance, they were aided by [[Suniel]], who bound them to an old oak tree. Upon connecting with Mat'Selesnya, this old Parun fused the three dryads with the World Tree, creating Trostani.
