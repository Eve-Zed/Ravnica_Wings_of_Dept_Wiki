Grandfather Karlov was the greediest of the [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]] Oligarchs in life. As a ghost he is a member of the [[Obzedat]], the oligarchy that rules the Orzhov Syndicate. His house sigil is a serpentine ouroboros.

As the head of the council, he gives final approval to its decisions and breakes ties within the group. Even if he is long dead, he hasn't lost his wealth, his power, and his greed, and clings fiercely to every scrap of influence his position in the council affords him. He casts a suspicious eye on the ambitious scheming of his descendant, [[Teysa Karlov|Teysa]]. In her position as Grand Envoy, Teysa served as the Obzedat's dealings with the living. Karlov responded to Teysa's schemes with grand plans of his own, growing his power by collecting the tithes of legions of sycophants and servitors.

When Teysa's attempt to seize power from the Obzedat failed, Karlov gave the order to imprison Teysa, eliminating her role of Grand Envoy, and canceling all dealings with other guilds.
