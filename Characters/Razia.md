Razia was the [[parun]] and leader of the [[Boros Legion]].

Razia has been the heart and soul of the Boros guild since the [[Guildpact#Singing of the Guildpact|signing of the guildpact]]. She was more like a demi-god to the army than a military leader, inspiring greatness and giving hope, meaning, and destiny to her Boros devout. Just to keep the black-hearted honest, she did, on occasion, rip the battlefield with holy fire.

It is said that all of the Boros angels were created as images of her, and are thus physically identical; however, it may be such that all other Boros angels are similar, not precisely the same.

She was the second parun to write her name during the Signing of the Guildpact. Ten millennia later, she was killed by [[Szadek]], who impaled her with her own sword, though he was enslaved by [[Augustin IV]] at the time. A [[Shapeshifter#Lupuls|lupul]] took her form and posed as her for a while, but it was ultimately destroyed by [[Agrus Kos]] and [[Pivlic]].
