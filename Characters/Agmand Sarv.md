The **hussar commander Agmand Sarv** is the **arbiter of the Lyev Column**, [[Azorius Senate|the senate]]'s law enforcement branch. Despite the fact that he has never been in combat, he has earned a reputation as a brilliant military strategist. His tactical genius is unquestioned, but his lack of battle experience did cause some controversy among the soldiers and lawmages of the Lyev Column when he was appointed to be its head.
