Commander Tajic, First Guildmage of the Legion, is a self assured [[human]] soldier of the [[Boros Legion]]. He has olive skin, a black goatee and speaks with a thick accent.

 Tajic is the highest ranking Boros guildmage, and one of the prime advisors of Warleader [[Aurelia]]. He's in charge of the Warmind Initiative, which is an effort to collaborate with the [[Izzet League|Izzet]] to increase Boros weapons and battle effectiveness.

Tajic ran the [[Implicit Maze]] as representative of the Boros. Later, he was asked by [[Teysa Karlov]] to help her remove the [[Obzedat]] from power. Their plot was foiled, and Tajic was taken prisoner by the Orzhov. Though Aurelia quickly managed to secure his release, the experience soured Tajic's relationship with Teysa significantly.
