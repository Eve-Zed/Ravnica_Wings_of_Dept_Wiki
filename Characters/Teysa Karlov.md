The scion of one of the most respected [[Orzhov Syndicate|Orzhov]] families, House Karlov, Teysa was employed as a notable "[[Lawmage|advokist]]", or lawmage, with a name and reputation that preceded her until she was made a baroness of the [[Utvara Reclamation Zone]]. There, Teysa came into contact with [[Zomaj Hauc]], who had schemes to control [[Ravnica]]; but, with an assembled force of warriors recruited from various sources, including the [[Ravnican guilds]], as well as her wealth of experience, arcane knowledge, and magic that allowed her to control a [[Dragon|dragon]], she was influential in stopping Hauc and, in return, gained her the respect of the inhabitants of the area and consolidated her power and authority.

Later on, Karlov was called upon by [[Feather]] as her advokist and entangled in the [[Nephilim|nephilim]] attacks and the events surrounding the disappearance and subsequent return of the [[Parhelion]].

After the breaking of the [[Guildpact]] and the [[Guildpact#Decamillennial Celebration|Decamillennial]], Teysa was intimately involved in the drafting of a new, non-magical Guildpact for the peace, order, and good government and relations of Ravnica and has been made the first and only Grand Envoy of the Orzhov Syndicate, thereby becoming the official speaker and ambassador for the guildmaster, the [[Obzedat]].

Not satisfied with that position, she conspired with the [[Boros Legion|Boros]] knight [[Tajic]] to remove the Obzedat from power. Tricking the [[Jace Beleren|Living Guildpact]] in providing her with the means to enter the Obzedat's Chamber, she almost retrieved the final evidence of the financial corruption of the Obzedat. In the end, she was foiled by her ghostly [[Grandfather Karlov|grandfather]] and stripped of her office of advokist and grand envoy by the Ghost Council.

Teysa remains in prison, because the Ghost Council is extorting corrupt officials to make sure they keep her locked away. At the same time, she is magically kept alive to prevent her from becoming a [[Spirit|ghost]]. Thanks to the efforts of her apprentice, [[Tomik Vrona]], she is able to keep abreast of the events in the outside world.
