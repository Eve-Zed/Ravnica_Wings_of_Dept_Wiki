Voja Fenstalker is a massive white [[Wolf]], and the companion of the [[Elf|elven]] evangelist [[Tolsimir Wolfblood]] of the [[Selesnya Conclave]].

Voja is the father of [[Biracazir]]. He has the sharpest senses of any living being within the Selesnya Conclave. His sense of smell is so keen that he once foiled [[Lazav]]'s attempts to infiltrate Selesnya territory, tracking the [[shapeshifter]] through multiple form changes and relentlessly hunting him until Lazav was forced to retreat, his mission incomplete. Disciplined and fiercely loyal, Voja rarely gives in to rage, but when he does, few are able to stand against his ferocity.
