A member of the Karlov family; not to be confused with [[Grandfather Karlov]]. As he slept with his brother's wife, he was therefore a direct ancestor of his "niece" [[Teysa Karlov]]. Teysa inherited the [[Utvara Reclamation Zone|Utvara]] district from him and became baroness once he passed away and joined the [[Obzedat|Ghost Council]].
