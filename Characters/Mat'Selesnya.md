Mat'Selesnya is the [[parun]] of the [[Selesnya Conclave]] and the worldsoul of [[Ravnica]].

As the guild's parun, Mat'Selesnya participated in the Signing of the [[Guildpact]]. An [[elemental]] formed from the union of several dryads, Mat'selesnya was encased within [[Vitu-Ghazi]] for several thousand years, until [[Szadek]] tried to destroy her during the [[Guildpact#Decamillennial Celebration|decamillennial]]. She is described as a being with bark-like skin, with large crystals inserted into her arms and legs and encasing her [[Dryad]]-like head. She currently still lives deep inside Vitu-Ghazi, and speaks through [[Trostani]]. Encompassing all things on the [[plane]] both alive and dead, she can even manifest the ghosts of severed branches of Vitu-Ghazi.
