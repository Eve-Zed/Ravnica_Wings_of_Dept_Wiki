Etrata is a [[Vampire|vampire]] assassin and a champion of [[House Dimir]]. She is a dark-skinned woman with impressive vampiric fangs. She is cold, fashionable, terrifyingly competent, and deeply nihilistic. She cares nothing for [[Ravnica]], and barely for her guild. Her only drive is to be the best spy in existence. A professional assassin with dozens of kills, she never kills for free and remembers each of her victims. As a member of the Dimir, she infiltrated other [[Ravnican guilds]] with ruthless ease and killed when necessary.

Etrata has the vampiric ability to induce fear with her gaze, sobering her victims with psychic power. Her footsteps are silent.
