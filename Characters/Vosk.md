Vosk is a high-ranking member of the [[House Dimir]] and a [[Vampire|vampire]] detective. He is charged both with retrieving memories as well as implanting identities and other information in the minds of others. One of his victims was the Dimir mage [[Sarusin]], whose memories were supplanted by that of a former Dimir excisor. When the [[Izzet League]] began their research into the [[Implicit Maze]], Vosk was assigned to gather as much knowledge of the maze as possible, leading him to cross paths with [[Jace Beleren]]. Ultimately, his presence as a Guild Champion was proven redundant by [[Lazav]]'s participation in the maze.
