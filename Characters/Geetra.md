Geetra is a precognitive mage who first put her gifts to use as a young thief on the streets of [[Ravnica]]. While still a teenager, she was apprehended and then pardoned in exchange for agreeing to use her talents in the service of the [[Azorius Senate]]. For decades, she worked in almost complete anonymity, her gifts unappreciated. But with the senate displaying an increased interest in the talents of [[Precognitive Mage|precognitive mages]], Geetra has been given a more prominent position, which she has embraced with enthusiasm. She worries about the impact that her guild has on the rest of Ravnica but believes in her heart that she is helping the people. Chaos can only destroy, and her visions are a tool to ensure that society can live in safety in all variants of the future.
