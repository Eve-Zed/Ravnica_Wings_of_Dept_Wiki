Jace is a [[Planeswalker]], with the ability to travel from world to world, and his attention never remains focused on [[Ravnica]] for long. Thanks to his involvement with other Planeswalkers, he spends extended periods of time away from Ravnica. During his absences, Ravnica has to fend for itself, and that means that the [[Ravnican guilds|guilds]] return to their old habits of fighting with each other over the smallest scraps of influence that could tilt the balance of power in their favour.
