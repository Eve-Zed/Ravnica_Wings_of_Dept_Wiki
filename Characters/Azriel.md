## Background

Having been raised in poverty by still very loving parents she soon discovered her love and talent for anything mechanical, often sneaking around and stealing discarded technical drawings from all over her city. Wanting to provide for her parents and give them a better life Azriel decided to use her engineering talent for monetary gain to make sure her parents could live a better life. Soon she ascended through the ranks at izzet and was able to fulfil her wish, being able to buy her parents a home near the factory she worked at. However only a few months later in a freak accident a burst pipe carrying molten steel ruptured, claiming many civilians lives, also hitting her parents home and killing both of them.

Devastated, Azriel finally lost her last bit of hope in the world, choosing to align her life with just getting as much power and money as possible, leaving her in the unstable and crazy mental state she will remain in until the current events.

Previously an engineer at izzet for many years, Azriel spent a lot of her time researching and pioneering the field of mechanical engineering, however she was never quite fond of doing work for someone other than herself.

After a joint-venture between Izzet and Orzhov focussing on the development of complex clockwork-driven machinery, she was very quickly offered a position by Orzhov executives, promising a massive paycheck (maybe only in exchange for the remaining bit of Azriel's moral compass).

Alongside her work, Azriel continued using her skills as an engineer to build up an illegal underground gambling operation, boasting her inventions as one-of-a-kind gambling machines. This however has not gone for her without trouble, having only narrowly escaped enemy forces and mafia groups on many occasions, requiring her to often lay low for quite some time until matters calmed down again.

Throughout her work at Orzhov she did not hesitate to make good use of her new gained trust, regularly granting herself access to otherwise highly classified documents within several of Orzov's library complexes. A discovery which stood out to her was the "truth" behind the contracts made with angels, which are usually shrouded in mystery to most people.

Having discovered that any contract made with an angel essentially means selling ones soul to said angel for the other party, she realized she could be taking advantage of this knowledge, purposefully seeking such a contract knowing its implications. Leveraging the huge price she would have to pay, she managed to strike an excellent deal with the angel named Rosalia Golitsyn, Seraph of the Unforgiven, with her not only being granted the powers of an excellent clockwork sorcerer, but also a practically unending supply of money.
