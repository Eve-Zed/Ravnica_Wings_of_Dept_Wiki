Leonos II born Obez Murzeddi, is a wise and kind human judge and [[Lawmage]] who takes pains to consider all perspectives before issuing a judgementâ€”even the perspectives of the spirits of the dead, with whom he can communicate. He is patient and utterly loyal to the guild.

He was originally an ectomancer und later became guild leader after [[Augustin IV]] was assassinated. He willingly gave that position to [[Isperia]] and became the Arbiter of the Sova Column.
